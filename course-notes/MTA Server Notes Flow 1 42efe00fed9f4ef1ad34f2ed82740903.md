=====> self study
Pa$$w0rd

1. Create [MeasureUp.com](http://measureup.com/) account (Mock Exams)
2. Create [Certiport.com](http://certiport.com/) account (Real Exam) then also Register with the MTA
and copy all details across
3. Map share to \\trainer\share UNC Path

Exam strategy for success this week

If you are going to pass one exam this week it will be MTA Security
Why? Security exam unchanged since 2012 + measure ups good + end of week
max time to understand material
Server and Networking : April : Upgraded BOTH EXAMS. So HARDER!!!
Books : Server : Unchanged
Networking & Security : upgraded
Server today : Teaching : pushing for time + add in extra NanoServer +
Storage Spaces + Containers
Advice for week
Proposal : today 315pm server exam IF CONFIDENT
Thursday 4pm networking exam or server
Saturday 3pm security and 145pm sit server/networking
Be aware!!! Measureups not yet in sync

	After turned on users will be able to recover PREVIOUS
		VERSIONS OF FILES

	Turn on in SERVER => COMPUTER MANAGEMENT => SHARING

		RT CLICK ==> SHADOW COPIES

		AND 'BEEPS' AT YOU WITH A BEEP CODE

		NORMAL RAM IS FAULTY!!!

	2) WINDOWS LOAD

		A) SECURE BOOT : HASH BOOT FILES TO ENSURE THEY 
				ARE NOT CORRUPT

Chapter 5

DNS

```
DNS has several types of record

A		ADDRESS = Standard lookup (PC01 ==> 1.2.3.4)
AAAA		IPV6 ADDRESS  (PC01 ==> FE80:1234:5678::FFFF)
MX		EMAIL (MAIL EXCHANGER) ==> TO EXCHANGE SERVER
CNAME		WEBSITE TRAFFIC TO WEBSERVER (ALIAS NAME WWW==>
						WEB SERVER)
SRV		LOCATE ACTIVE DIRECTORY SERVICES
PTR		REVERSE LOOKUP (POINTER)    (1.2.3.4==>PC01)		
					((SECURITY))
SOA		MASTER COPY (START OF AUTHORITY)
NS		READ COPY OF DNS (NAME SERVER)

WINS is OLD DNS (Hostname only)

GlobalName 	SERVER22	recognise this in ALL DOMAINS

NSLOOKUP	DNS lookup on domain (find dns server ip)

```

Active Directory

```
LDAP		CN=PHIL,OU=OU,DC=MYDOMAIN,DC=COM  underlying 			structure
		Port 389

Kerberos	Security Protocol
		
SSO		Single Sign On

Domain		Security boundary

	Trust	Transitive Trust : A trusts B, B trusts C so 
				   A now trusts C by implication

Site		Physical area : geographical location eg Birmingham

	Subnet	IP Range for Birmingham eg 10.20.30.0 network

ADAC AD Admin Center	

Group Policy	push settings to computers
		GPUPDATE /FORCE 	push changes now

Client
Domain Controller	runs ACTIVE DIRECTORY
Member Server		eg SQL server, member of domain,  
`			not AD Domain Controller

Global Catalog		Quick search
FSMO Roles 		Unique roles eg PDC Emulator password reset

SID		SecurityID		PC ID
GUID		128 bit Global ID	Domain ID

Delegating Control of an OU
		1) Right click on OU : add user
		2) User PC : install 'RSAT REMOTE SERVER ADMIN
			TOOLS'  ==> partial permission over
			active directory

```

Users
Local
Profile at c:\users
SAM	LOCAL LOGIN DATABASE

```
Domain		
	Roaming profile		profile on server : copy down
				to any computer
	Folder redirection	all data stays on server
	NTUSER.DAT		REGISTRY SETTINGS PER USER
	Mandatory profile	read only user : changes not saved
				((change NTUSER.DAT to NTUSER.MAN))

```

Groups

```
Global 		valid in THIS DOMAIN

Universal	valid in ALL DOMAINS

Security	use with PERMISSIONS

Distribution	use for EMAIL ONLY

```

Group Policy

```
Order of applying (priority)

Local			FIRST  (GPEDIT.MSC : view local policy)

Site			SECOND

Domain			THIRD

OU			FOURTH

	Sub-OU		FIFTH

			LAST POLICY APPLIED WINS

```

Chapter 6 : Permissions

```
RIGHT		ON MACHINE EG right to log in, shut down, change
		time etc 

PERMISSION	NTFS permission on folder eg Full control

```

NTFS

```
ACL	List of users 				ACCESS CONTROL LIST
ACE	Entry (fine permission) given to a user		       ENTRY

Inherited permission : greyed out
Explicit permission  : we can set
	DENY beats ALLOW!!!
	but EXPLICIT always beats INHERITED (even beats inherited
							DENY)

Copy vs Move

	C:\\ to C:\\  	MOVING IN SAME VOLUME : KEEP ALL PERMISSIONS

	C:\\ to D:\\	MOVE TO DIFFERENT VOLUME : LOSE
			PERMISSIONS AND TAKE ON NEW PARENT PERMISSION

	COPY		Always lose permissions : take on new
			parent permission

Owner = Creator of a file
	
	Change = take ownership

Adding permissions

	NTFS ONLY	READ + FULL CONTROL  ==> FULL CONTROL

		BEST PERMISSION WINS

	NTFS AND SHARE	: MOST RESTRICTIVE WINS

		NTFS READ
		SHARE FULL CONTROL

			==> READ IS YOUR FINAL PERMISSION	

```

Printing

```
Driver	old : pulled from Print Server (machine where printer 			installed)
	new : Type 4 : pulled from Microsoft Update

Job	File sent to print server

	Spool folder	Print jobs stored here

Pool	

	Large company : users print to ONE PRINTER but in print 
		room may be linked to 5 printers : print to any
		one.  Pool of printers.

```

Auditing

```
Auditing ==> LOG EVENTS TO EVENT VIEWER , SECURITY LOG

Turn on auditing : 

	1) Group Policy => Security => turn on eg 'Audit Object
					Access'  (any file/folder)

	2) Folder => Security => Advanced ==> turn on auditing
			for a user/group

```

Chapter 7 : Network Services

```
FTP File transfer protocol

	OLD!
	Insecure!!

SMTP : Send email

	
Web Server (IIS)

	'host' web sites

	Multiple sites on one server

		Virtual Directories also to add in extra paths

			c:\\myextrapath     <http://mydomain/extra>

	50 web sites hosted

		1 site crashes ==> affect other 49!

		"Application Pool" with eg 5 sites max

			limit damage if one site does go down

	Default page

		user type 'gotothissite.com'

		website ==> default file

			index.htm or .html
			Default.htm
			Default.asp
