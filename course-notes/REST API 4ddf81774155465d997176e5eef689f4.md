# REST

## Introduction

REST allows us to obtain data across the internet.  It is sent using the HTTP protocol which is also used to display websites.

## Summary

```	 
REST was invented in 2000 by Roy Fielding at University of California.  It has displaced SOAP and other XML-based methods of obtaining information because of its ease of use.
REST uses HTTP to transfer data.
REST is STATELESS (no knowledge of previous or future transactions ie each transaction is completely standalone)
REST exposes data using directory structure inside a URL www.mydomain.com/getdata/1  will get record 1
REST can transfer XML or JSON data.
```
