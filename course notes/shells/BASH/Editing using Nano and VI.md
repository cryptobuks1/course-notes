# Editing using Nano and VI

We can use any text editor to create and edit scripts but common ones on Linux systems are VI and Nano and often you will find yourself in an environment which looks quite foreign and alien.  This may be one of these environments just displayed in front of you without you even asking!  So we must be ready to handle it!

# Using the VI editor

    `i` will invoke INSERT mode whereby text can be added to the screen
    
    When finished, press escape and then press 
    
     `:wq` to close and save changes
     `:q`  to close without saving changes

# Using The Nano Editor

    :return  next line
    :space   next page
    :q       quit
    :w       previous page
    :h       help
