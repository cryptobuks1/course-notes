# Day 38 - API Lab

Challenge the class to break into groups of 3.

Together they will choose an API on the internet (better to choose a simple and free one).

After this is chosen, then build a C# application to read data from the API.

This can be done in 3 stages

a) Obtain ANY DATA in ANY WAY from the API in ANY FORM 

b) Using Newtonsoft convert the data to JSON

c) Deserialize the JSON to C# instances of a given type.  If necessary use JSON2CSharp library to automatically generate C# Models from JSON types.
