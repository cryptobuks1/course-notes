# Azure

Publishing an app to Azure

1) Get your SQL script

2) Log into Azure and create an SQL database.  Scale it down to the cheapest possible as this is not the default.

3) Find the place where you can run a raw query against the database.  Run your SQL script to create the database with seeding of raw data also.

4) Make sure you have written down the SQL username and password.
