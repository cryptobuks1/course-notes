# Personalities and Conflicts

    Think 'WIN - WIN'   for both parties   
    
    Reasons 
    
    	Personality
    
    	Lack of care with communication : text/email/phone/face-to-face
    
    	Working style
    
    Good to have people with different styles etc in a successful group
    
    	Successful group : 
    
    		Introverts
    		Extroverts
    		Team player
    		Leader
    		Tech / Analytical thinker   
    
    
    	Nullifier : seek peace in conflict
    	Seeker    : stir up conflict???

# Email management

    Techniques for managing inbox
    
    'Inbox zero'  ==> goal is get rid of ALL EMAILS
    
    	INBOX   (emails to do, for action)
    	ARCHIVE (emails dealt with)
    	FOLDERS
    		BY
    			TOPIC
    				WITH
    					SUBTOPIC       (archived by topic)
    
    Try working from OLDEST EMAILS UP???
    
    
    
    Tips for email success
    
    	1.  If you want to reply to non-critical emails, don't do it early in the morning.
    
    			Either use Outlook - delay reply 
    			Or batch say 3pm/4pm etc later on
    
    	2.  Turn off emails completely when focus on real work
    
    			((even phone : move away from immediate personal space))

# Productivity

    Planning
    
    	Good to plan with clear goals and focus
    
    		DAILY
    		WEEKLY
    		? MONTHLY?
    
    	Daily : tips
    
    		1) Evening before, when day is done, eg on relax train home or last thing
    
    			Write out tasks for next day
    
    				SET THREE GOALS 1) 2) 3) 
    
    					((Text to accountability partner))
    
    		2) First thing : get to work on 'main task'
    
    				FIRST PERIOD OF DAY IS MOST PRODUCTIVE IN GENERAL
    
    					PLAN WELL ==> GET 2/3 HOURS OF INCREDIBLE WORK DONE BEFORE DAY STARTS
    
    		3)  Workplace ==> good pair of LARGE headphones : SIGNAL 'I'm working'

## English as a language

    Grammarly : use it and learn from it!!!
    
    Spelling : don't use automatic spell checker but ==> REWRITE WORD YOURSELF, AGAIN, FROM SCRATCH
    
    Remember  ==> PROGRAMMERS ARE CREATORS AND WRITERS!!!
    
    	Technical spec ==> language can be very precise, must use English language well to understand
    						instructions, formulate any reply, or thoughts, or communications about 
    						the work.

Maths : don't be scared of it ==> become an expert in Maths!

    Strong coders are confident in practical mathematics.

Ad-hoc

    Delicate/sensitive matters
    
    	FACE TO FACE IS ALWAYS BETTER
    
    	Writing ==> firstly compose your email but don't send it.  Pause, come back to it a while later or
    					overnight.  Re-read, edit carefully.  Think about person you are sending to and 
    					possible consequences.  
    
    
    Professionalism here at Sparta
    
    	Keep it professional if there are people present that you don't know that well
    
    		SLOUCHING/PHONE USAGE/PAYING ATTENTION IF SOMEONE IS TALKING
    
    			Care!  Manager/Sales team member present ==> err on side professionalism
    
    
    
    Dictation ==> use it!

# Lominger Behaviour

    Progress can be very SUBJECTIVE ie different people look at things in different ways
    
    LOMINGER attempts to put a professional look on how progress is scored and measured
    
    LOMINGER looks at 4 categories
    
    	BEHAVIOUR : what you DO
    
    	TECHNICAL : what you KNOW
    
    	ATTITUDE : how you THINK
    
    	ATTRIBUTES : natural QUALITIES / GIFTINGS
    
    
    Academy (Sparta training) measure you on several fronts
    
    	ATTENDANCE : daily : INFORM BY TEAMS APP ==> IF YOU THINK YOU WILL BE LATE
    
    	BEHAVIOUR
    
    		Score weekly basis out of 8 (best)
    
    			HORSEPOWER ==> ability to work hard, raw output
    
    			INTERPERSONAL ==> relationship/people skills
    
    			PERSEVERANCE ==> overcome difficulties
    
    			SELF DEVELOPMENT ==> proactivity in self-learning ((consolidate existing 
    						material AND/OR progress with learning new stuff))
    
    			STANDING ALONE ==> voice for yourself, part of a group but CONTRIBUTING TO 
    						THE GROUP AS A WHOLE.  Professionally making your opinion known.
    						'Perk up' even if you feel maybe you have an insight which the
    						the group has not 'got' yet.
    
    						SPARTAN 'CONSULTANT' HAS TO OPERATE LIKE THIS
    
    			PROBLEM SOLVING ==> curiosity, solving issues, helping others???
    
    
    	CODING 
    
    			FUNCTIONALITY ==> does code work?
    
    			READABILITY ==> flow, structure, indentation, comments
    
    			REUSABILITY / MAINTAINABILITY
    
    				DRY : Don't Repeat Yourself
    
    					MODULAR : SMALL TESTABLE BLOCKS (UNITS)  "UNIT TESTING"
    
    						Class ==> single use / focus
    
    						Method (action code) ==> one clear goal			
    
    			GIT / GITHUB
    
    				GIT = local versions
    				GITHUB = online repository
    
    
    	PRESENTATION SKILLS
    
    		INTRO / CLOSURE
    
    		DESIGN
    
    		POISE / POSTURE   ()
    
    		SUBJECT MATTER KNOWLEDGE
    
    		ELOCUTION : WAY YOU SPEAK
    
    		==> goal for this week ((Friday???))  ==> prepare and deliver a presentation
    					on any subject matter of your choice 
    
    
    	PROJECT WORK
    
    
    	INTERVIEW SKILLS
    
    		Appearance
    		Behaviour 
    		Knowledge (Tech, also of Academy and what's expected of you)
    		Integrity = honest / transparent

# Time Management

    Under-promise, Over-deliver
    
    	Be cautious when promising timescales on something YOU HAVE TO DELIVER!
    
    		Normally you NEVER ESTIMATE CORRECTLY and it ALWAYS TAKES LONGER
    
    20/80 principle (Pareto principle)
    
    	Be careful with your EFFORT
    
    		20% OF YOUR EFFORT (IN THE RIGHT PLACE) CAN PROVIDE 80% OF YOUR GAINS
    
    			Productivity : LIST CRITICAL TASKS AND HIT THEM HEAD ON FIRST THING
    
    				No email/social/phone(airplane mode) + use headphones??
    
    
    Breaking down tasks to decide CRITICAL/IMPORTANT/URGENT/DON'T-DO
    
    			very				not
    			urgent 				urgent
    
    
    
    important	1 "Urgent"	2 "Quality"
    FIRE-FIGHTING	IMPORTANT BUT NOT URGENT
    REALLY IMPORTANT
    REALLY URGENT
    
    not	3 "Deception" 4 "Waste (of time)"
    important	NOT IMPORTANT
    (FAKE) URGENCY
    
    
    

# Task Management

Techniques for getting stuff done

    TIMEBOXING : setting a FIXED LIMIT ON THE TIME AVAILABLE FOR A TASK

Managing Lots Of Tasks

    1. Capture Tasks INTO ONE PLACE : Emails/Chat/Todo/...
    
    2. Prioritise Important/Urgent etc
    
    3. Begin tasks
    
    4. Larger projects ==> 
    
    	Plan
    
    	Track progress
    
    	Report on progress

## Calendar Management

    Please learn how to book important stuff into your calendar
    
    	Commitment ==> Put it in writing 
    
    		If you say 'yes' to someone/thing then WRITE IT DOWN

## How to avoid meaningless meetings

    It's a real skill to have effective meetings
    
    Developers ==> STAND UP!!!
    
    	Sit down, coffee, relax ==> hard to motivate etc
    
    Simple steps
    
    	Best ==> short, snappy meetings : STANDS UP, QUICK AGENDA, 10/15 mins, 
    											done
    
    	Longer ==> choose attendees with care
    			1. Set clear agenda (writing)
    			2. Send agenda beforehand : ask to prepare ((get good input))
    			3. Clear leader to keep on track / watch time
    			4. Report : clear follow up actions
    			            'minutes' ie what was discussed
    
    
    Developer Standup 
    	1.  Did yesterday?
    	2.  Today
    	3.  Blocker/Hindrances

Slides

    KISS  Keep It Simple, Stupid!!!!

Risk Management

    For big projects there is a high risk of failure, either as a whole or of 
    components.
    
    We can attempt to 'monetise' (put into financial terms) the possible
    		things which may go wrong, and the cost if they do.
    
    RISK : % chance of event Y happening with loss £££xxx.00
    
    		Develop product : 20% chance competitor beat us to it
    									Reduce sales by £1,000,000
    
    RESPONSE
    		IGNORE / ACCEPT
    		MITIGATE : TAKE STEPS TO REDUCE RISK  (Road : rebuild a traffic
    					'collision hotspot')
    		INSURE : eg against burglary
    		AVOID  : do something else (build another product instead)

# Financial Terms

    ROI 	Return On Investment  :   7% ROI means if you invest £100 then after 
    									a year you get back £7 plus your investment
    									if you want it back
    
    Cost-benefit analysis 		  :   Project - what will it cost, and what are 
    									benefits to business
    
    										TANGIBLE       measure, quantify 
    										INTANGIBLE      Public relations,
    														Reputation etc

# Project Management

    BAU Business As Usual ==> normal work
    
    Projects are
    
    	Unique
    	Transient
    	Focused
    	Clear goal
    	Normally have phases
    	Often hire contractors or specialists to get the work done
    	Often are complex
    
    Creating high quality takes time and money
    
    	TRIPLE CONSTRAINT
    
    		BALANCE             QUALITY   VS   TIME     VS    MONEY
    
    IT is at heart of most projects today
    
    	POPIT
    
    							People
    
    							IT
    
    				Processes 			Organisation(company)

Project Stages

    Initiation, Planning, Execution, Monitoring, Completion

# The Way You Think : Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP)

    Neuro
    
    	Way that electricity makes its way into your brain
    
    	Five senses : Sight, Hearing, Smell, Touch, Taste
    
    Linguistic
    
    	Education and learning (via language) to learn the correct way to interpret, 
    	learn and create meaning from these external signals
    
    Programming
    
    	Final output : programming of our life : leads to the actions which we take

We are all WIRED DIFFERENTLY ==> THINK DIFFERENTLY

    ENCOURAGE AND CELEBRATE DIVERSITY OF THOUGHT, OPINION ETC
    
    REDUCE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES 
    
    	'Bias'  ==> Personal opinion affects professional judgement
    
    			Objective   Based on FACTS
    			Subjective  Based on OPINION

# Ways that BIAS might be introduced

    PRESSURE OF
    
    	TIME 			snap decisions, not always best
    
    	MONEY 			overall wealth
    					short-term CASH FLOW 
    
    LACK OF INFORMATION : BEING IGNORANT OF THE FACTS
    
    	(Can take hard work to dig out the facts)
    
    OVERWHELMING CHOICE 
    
    PERSONAL PREJUDICE

Other ways bias might be introduced

    Anchoring 				Take first suitable option (lazy)
    
    Choice-supporting 		Your preference : so make choices around what you want
    
    Confirmation 			After you've made a decision, you want the facts to 
    						support your decision ('bending the facts/truth')
    
    Outcome 				Choice is not based on good rationale but tends to be 
    						worried or concerned about the consequences, and choose
    						accordingly
    
    Band-wagon 				What everyone else thinks
    
    Authority 				Following lead of leaders
