# API

# Web !!!

Web realm is incredibly exciting

```
Check out BLAZOR which is C# natively running in Browser.

Today we are going to check out APIs which power much of the web.

Website 										HUMAN CONSUMPTION 	 HTML structure
																	 CSS colour, animations
																	 JAVASCRIPT code

API  (Application Programming Interface) 		MACHINE CONSUMPTION  DATA in form of
																		1) JSON 
																		2) XML  

JSON 
{
   "field":value,
   "field":value
}

[
	{
	   "field":value,
   		"field":value
	},
	{
	   "field":value,
   		"field":value
	}
]

XML
<rootElement>  										< >  Tag , Element  ((ONE ROOT ONLY))
	<item length="1">                               Element with Attribute (length) and Value (1)
		<field otherValue="admin">Value</field>
	</item>
</rootElement>
```

Goal

```
1) Northwind
2) Entity Framework
3) Scaffold API from scratch with minimal work
```

MVC Methodology

```
Model  		Database Item  ==> C#     Class matches database Table
									  Northwind Customers ==> Class Customer

View 		Display of data to end user : HTML/CSS/Javascript + server-side data fed into page
										   (translated into HTML/CSS/Javascript)

			Server                           		    Client
			C#/Node/PHP/Java/Python/Ruby
				Render
				    Translate raw data into
				    form suitable for viewing
				    ie HTML etc    ================>>>Sent to client for display=====>

Controller  look at URL to make sense of it

				<https://www.mydomain.com/controller/action/id>

					                    /customers/Get/           SELECT *
					                    /customers/Get/ALFKI      SELECT .. where id=ALFKI
					                    /customers/Post/          NEW 
					                    /customers/Post/id        UPDATE
					                     could be /Put/id 		  UPDATE

				GET : request VISIBLE IN URL
				POST : 	request is INSIDE WEB PAGE DATA

	Controller
		a) Analyse URL
		b) According to instructions in URL, go and get relevant data from Model
		c) Send that data to a VIEW PAGE which display DATA
```

MVC Summary

```
MODEL : DATA
CONTROLLER : TAKE REQUEST AND RETURN DATA TO VIEW
VIEW : DISPLAY
```

# API using .NET Core

Microsoft is strongly pushing .NET Core so let's use this opportunity to explore what it means to use .NET Core to read a database

Goals

1. 'Code First' approache to build our code, and from this to create a database

    ```
    a) SQLServer   
     b) SQLite      ==> try this way this time
    ```

2. Seed data from C# ie create new database with new data
3. Create API

# Setup

.Net Core 2.1 Web App with API

```
Install libraries EntityFrameworkCore/SqLite/Design  v 2.1.1

a) install-package ...     			NUGET
b) dotnet add package ... 			POWERSHELL

	dotnet add package microsoft.entityframeworkcore.design -v 2.1.1
```
