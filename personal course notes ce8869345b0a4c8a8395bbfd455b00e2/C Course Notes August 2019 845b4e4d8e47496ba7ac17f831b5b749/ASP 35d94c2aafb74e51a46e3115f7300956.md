# ASP

# ASP Core Website With Entity

Let's move our learning forwards.

```
Critical learning for the course

	Basic HTML/CSS ==> done (enough)
	Javascript : minimal
		(upgrade)
	Bootstrap  : need to play around with
	Entity with LINQ : done apart from advanced LINQ
	Entity Core : started today
	Generating and migrating databases : minimal today ==> can do more
	API : started
	ASP : simple website
	MVC : done a good bit, can develop
```

New ASP site v 2.1 and EFCore libraries 2.1.1

### Adding libraries using Powershell

dotnet add package microsoft.entityframeworkcore -v 2.1.1
.sqlserver
.sqlite
.design

### Adding pages

Note

```
ASP WEB ==> 2 files per page     .cshtml  as root
								 .cshtml.cs  with raw c# code 'behind' the page

MVC     ==> 1 file per page      .cshtml

Shared\\_Layout   page   has all of the shared layout

_ means private ie cannot view this page directly; only via another page

Startup.cs
	Set basis for website
	Install all libraries
	Can configure global access to database (later on for our learning 'injecting
			context' from database into our app)

UseStaticFiles()

	wwwroot global folder with all non-secure data
		CSS
		IMAGES
		JS LIBRARIES EG BOOTSTRAP

Database Connection Strings

	1) App.Config (core only)
	2) Web.Config                 older 
	3) appsettings.json 	      newer

Pages
	index.cshtml
	..

Models
	Customer.cs
	..

C# in webpage is called RAZOR

@page required first line ==> RAZOR PAGE otherwise RAW HTML

@model refers to DATA IN C# TWIN PAGE

@Model is used in RAZOR to access data

ViewData/ViewBag are ARRAY OF STRINGS to push trivial data on any page
