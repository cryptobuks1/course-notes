File Extensions

	.txt
	.jpg

		Rename myFile.txt to myFile.jpg what is it?  It's still a TEXT FILE.

File Signatures

	Pattern of 1's and 0's at the START OF A FILE WHEN IT'S LAID DOWN ON DISK 
		(IE WRITTEN) WHICH INDICATES THE FILE TYPE.

	File Signatures are PUBLICLY KNOWN

		Drive Recovery Programs can SCAN THE DISK FOR KNOWN SIGNATURES IN ORDER
		TO ATTEMPT TO RECREATE DELETED FILES 

ASCII

	USA built first computers ==> US English is default character set on Web.

	7 bits ie numbers 0 through 127

		(int)char will yield this number eg (int)'f'

UTF8

	0 added on end of ASCII

	01010101 

	Web is built using characters exclusively from UTF8 set

[https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/#starter-template](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/#starter-template)[getbootstrap.com](http://getbootstrap.com/) ==> <meta charset="utf-8">

```
BASE64 is therefore used to TRANSPORT ALL DATA WHICH IS NOT IN THIS SIMPLE
		CHARACTER SET

			<<complex data>>  ==>  chop it into blocks of 6 bit wide

							  ==>  each 6-bit block allocated ASCII letter

							  ==>  SEND DATA AS ASCII

							  ==>  Process reversed at receiving end

UTF16

	Russian/Chinese languages etc have many characters
	Using 16 bits we can now describe most characters in world.

		ASCII 2^7 = 128
		UTF16 => 2^16 ==> 65536 characters

UNICODE = UTF16

C# .NET default encoding is 16 bit      ((but .NET core defaulting ??? 8 bit ???))

SecureString can be used as an input type which is slightly more secure than standard string.
No strings are completely secure
