Proposal today
SQL : Create database with rabbit tables
Entity : C# ==> hook into this database
View, Update Rabbits

SQL commands

```
View => Server Explorer.  Data Connection, Add
	(localdb)\\mssqllocaldb 
View => SQL Object Explorer	

	Gives access to the local computer using SQL server

	Files called ....mdf Microsoft Database File
	Stored in C:\\Users\\<username>\\ folder
```

```
use master
go

drop database if exists RabbitDb
go

create database RabbitDb
go

use RabbitDb
go

drop table if exists Rabbits

CREATE TABLE Rabbits(
	RabbitId INT NOT NULL IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
	Age INT NULL,
	Name VARCHAR(50) NULL
);

INSERT INTO Rabbits Values ('1','Rabbit01')
INSERT INTO Rabbits Values ('0','Rabbit02')
INSERT INTO Rabbits Values ('0','Rabbit03')

SET IDENTITY_INSERT Rabbits ON
INSERT INTO Rabbits (RabbitId, Age, Name) values (4,0,'Rabbit04')
SET IDENTITY_INSERT Rabbits OFF

select 'Rabbit Database'

UPDATE Rabbits Set Name='Changed' WHERE RabbitId=3

delete from rabbits where RabbitId=4

select * from Rabbits
```

# SQL Day 2

# SQL Warm Up

Create from scratch

A database
3 Tables which have
One main table
Two Sub-tables which have foreign keys in the main table eg

```
Students (main)
		Qualifications (sub)
		Teachers (sub)
		Grades (sub)
		Classroom (sub)

	Create somewhere some data which has
		INT
		DATE  eg DATEOFBIRTH
		BIT  (0 or 1)
		TINYINT (0 TO 255)
```

Fill with data
Use INNER JOIN to show some data across all 3 tables
Use DATEDIFF to find the difference between today and the given date
Use DATEADD to add 7 days to the given date
INSERT A NEW RECORD
UPDATE A RECORD
DELETE A RECORD
Select items where a field is LIKE '%abc%' ie contains the letters 'abc'

# SQL

Sql theory terms

4 categories

DML Data Manipulation Language
Basic queries : SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE (CRUD operations)

DDL Data Definition Language
Create Data Structures ie Database/Table
CREATE/DROP - database & table ie add new or remove completely
ALTER table ie to add key/column
TRUNCATE remove

DCL Data Control Language
Permissions GRANT / REVOKE

TCL Transaction Control Language
Group of transactions TOGETHER
1) COMMIT (all of transactions in the group as a whole) eg ATM withdrawl
is either ALL COMMIT or nothing.
2) ROLLBACK to a given point eg start of transaction group
3) SAVEPOINT : mid-way point of saving data progression throughout
a series of transactions

# Basic Commands

```
use db01   // bring into scope

# UPDATE

```
UPDATE mytable set name='fred' where id=2

# DELETE

## care - can delete all records if omit 'where'

```
DELETE from mytable WHERE id=2
```

# Normal Form

Aims to ensure INTEGRITY of data within a database ie all of the relationships make sense, and all of the data is current and can be found quickly with the right searches.
No duplication of data etc.

1st Normal Form

```
One field should hold One item of data only eg mobile phone field should not hold
			2 mobile numbers

Atomic : as small as possible ie 1 unit of data per cell
```

2nd Normal Form

```
All keys depend on PRIMARY KEY
```

3rd Normal Form

```
No keys should have any inter-dependent relationships with each other 

	Name, Address, Postcode, City, County.

		In theory the City and County actually are related

	Name, Address, Postcode, City

	County
		City1
		City2
```

# top

```
select top 10 * from customers
```

# select where ... and ...

```
select * from products where unitsinstock < 10 and discontinued=0 
order by unitsinstock desc
```

# operators

```
AND OR   

<>    or    !=       (NOT EQUAL TO)

>    <    >=    <=
```

# SELECT DISTINCT

```
select country from customers order by country 
select distinct country from customers order by country
```

# CONTAINS ==> SQL 'like' keyword

```
# contains 'abc'
like '%abc%' 
# start
like 'abc%'
# end
like '%abc'
# does not contain
like %[^abc]%
select * from products where ProductName not like 'ch%'
```

# MULTIPLE EXACT HITS - USE 'IN' KEYWORD

```
# same as 'region = wa and region = bc and region = ..'

select * from employees where region IN ('wa','bc')
```

# BETWEEN A AND B

```
select * from products where unitprice between 10 and 20
```

# CUMULATIVE FUNCTIONS

```
SUM, COUNT, AVERAGE, MIN, MAX
```

```
/* COUNT CITY, COUNTRY */
select count(distinct city) as 'cities', count(distinct country) as 'countries' from customers
select count(distinct country) from customers

/* AVERAGE PRICE, MIN PRICE, MAX PRICE */
select avg(unitprice) as 'averageprice', 
min(unitprice) as 'minprice',
max(unitprice) as 'maxprice',
count(*) as 'count' from products
select min(unitprice) as 'minprice' from products
select max(unitprice) as 'maxprice' from products
/* SUM OF UNITS ON STOCK */
select sum(UnitsInStock) as 'Stock Total' from products
```

# as select ... as ...

# Maths

Easy to do mathematical operations inside the query

EG Product discount

```
£100 with 10% discount ==> sell for £90

// Get product, price, discount, price including discount from ORDER DETAILS

// customer ==> place order with OrderID

// order ==> details with Order_DetailId

// Get total of (quantity*unitprice) as 'ordervalue'
// get total of (1-discount)* 'ordervalue'
```

```
select * from orders
select * from [Order Details]
-- Get product, price, discount, price including discount from ORDER DETAILS
select ProductName, Quantity, [Order Details].UnitPrice, Discount, 
([order details].UnitPrice*(1-Discount)) as 'Discount Price' from [Order Details]
inner join Products on products.productid = [order details].productid
order by 'Discount Price' desc
-- Get total of (quantity*unitprice) as 'ordervalue'
select sum(unitprice*quantity) from [order details]
-- get total of (1-discount)* 'ordervalue'
select sum(unitprice*quantity*(1-discount)) from [Order Details]
-- difference
select
sum(unitprice*quantity) as 'gross sales',
sum(unitprice*quantity*(1-discount)) as 'discounted sales',
(sum(unitprice*quantity) - sum(unitprice*quantity*(1-discount))) as 'discount given'
from [order details]
```

# substring

```
substring(string, startindex, length)
substring('cheese',,2) returns 'he'
```

# charindex

charindex(' ','BR23 4AZ') returns 5 the index of the space

LTRIM removes leading spaces

Replace('some text','text','cheese') returns 'some cheese'

UPPER

Lower

# case .. when .. else

case
when (x>10) then 'old'
else 'young'
end
as 'are you old?'

# group by .. having

Order by ONLY WORKS FOR FIELDS WHICH EXIST INITIALLY BUT NOT ON CUMULATIVE FIELDS

```
so we can find the sum of all units in stock per product category but this field
does not exist initially so we can't order by this field.

Cumulative fields ie SUM/MAX/MIN/AVG/COUNT
Group By    (selecting into batches)
Having .... (same as order by)
```

Order matters
SELECT (unitprice*discount) DISTINCT FROM WHERE .....
GROUP BY ... HAVING ....
ORDER BY ...

```
select 'GROUP BY'
select supplierid, sum(unitsonorder) as 'Total Units On Order' from products
group by supplierid
having sum(unitsonorder) = 0
order by 'total units on order' desc

select 'GROUP BY'
select supplierid, sum(unitsonorder) as 'Total Units On Order' from products
group by supplierid
having sum(unitsonorder) > 0
order by 'total units on order' desc
```

# JOINS

INNER JOIN = LEFT JOIN

```
table1        table2
	table1id    table2id  

All from table1 plus matching from table2 only where there is a match
```

OUTER JOIN = RIGHT JOIN

```
All from table2 plus matching records from table1
```

FULL JOIN

```
All from table1 plus all from table2 and NULL if no matching record in table2
```

# SUBQUERIES

Query within a query : useful for large, long queries

```
// FIND CUSTOMERS WITH NO ORDERS
select ... from ... where (select ... from ...)
select * from customers where customerID not in (select customerID from orders)
```

# Extra terms

IDENTITY(1,1) Autoincrement starting at value 1 and jump by 1 each time
IDENTITY Autoincrement
PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED : Only one primary key

# Connection Strings And Environment Variables

We can build a connection string

```
using System;
using System.Data.Sql;  // TALK TO SQL DIRECT
using System.Data.SqlClient;

namespace lab_38_raw_sql
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            string connectionstring = @"Data Source=localhost;Initial Catalog=Northwind;Persist Security Info=True; User ID=SA;Password=Passw0rd2018";
            using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionstring))
            {
                connection.Open();
                Console.WriteLine(connection.State);
            }

            string connectionstring2 = @"Data Source=(localdb)\\mssqllocaldb;Initial Catalog=Northwind;";
            using (var connection2 = new SqlConnection(connectionstring2)) {
                connection2.Open();
                Console.WriteLine(connection2.State);
            }

        }
