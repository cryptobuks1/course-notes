Domain

	Central server = DOMAIN CONTROLLER

		Clients 'join' the domain and come under
		the umbrella of central security

		MULTIMASTER = MANY DOMAIN CONTROLLERS, ALL
		FULFILLING SAME FUNCTION 

		ACTIVE DIRECTORY = PROGRAM IN WINDOWS TO
		CREATE A DOMAIN AND RUN A DOMAIN CONTROLLER

		PERMANENT : CLIENTS JOIN AND STAY JOINED

Client - Server  relationship

	EG LOG IN TO OUR BANK

PEER-TO-PEER NETWORK

	WINDOWS CLIENTS ON SAME NETWORK BUT NO CENTRAL 
			SERVER TO MANAGE THEM

		NO CENTRAL SECURITY
		NO BACKUPS ...

		OK FOR HOME OR SMALL OFFICE 

			SOHO = SMALL OFFICE, HOME OFFICE

	BE ANOTHER ROUTER).  SET OUR ENCRYPTION.
	CREATE 'TUNNEL' TO SEND DATA, ENCRYPTED, TO THAT
	OTHER IP ADDRESS.

```

NETWORK COMPONENTS

HUB

```
FIRST EVER NETWORKS CREATED USED HUBS

PURELY FORWARD ELECTICITY ARRIVING AT ONE PORT, 
SEND OUT SAME PULSES ON ALL OTHER PORTS

---->IN---HUB===> OUT (SAME SIGNAL)

THIS WAS GOOD FOR SMALL NETWORKS.

TODAY HUBS ARE TERRIBLE.

	BECAUSE ==> BROADCAST TRAFFIC TO ALL DEVICES ALWAYS

		CREATE 'NOISE' ON NETWORK

	((UNICAST = 1-1))
	((BROADCAST = 1 TO MANY))

SPEED OF HUB = 10Mbps

BUT DECREASES WITH N DEVICES TO 1/N SPEED

10 DEVICES ==> 1/10 SPEED (AT BEST)

```

BRIDGE

```
OLD, WAS USED TO CONNECT DIFFERENT TYPES OF NETWORKS

	EG TOKEN RING FROM IBM TO ETHERNET

	(WORKS AT LAYER 2)

```

REPEATER

```
LIKE HUB 

ONLY GOT 2 PORTS 

JUST USED TO EXTEND LENGTH OF A NETWORK

EG

ETHERNET 100M MAX LENGTH

	100M : REPEATER : 100M 

	-----200m total-------

	
5-4-3 rule : 5 NETWORKS WITH 4 REPEATERS BUT ONLY 3 CAN 
		HAVE COMPUTERS IN THEM!

```

FIRST NETWORKS

```
10 MBPS  : USED THICK COAX CABLE CALLED 'THICKNET'  

THEN

10 MBPS  : THINNET (STILL COAX) - LIKE TV CABLE TODAY

THEN

ETHERNET : 10/100/1000/10000 MBPS TODAY!!!

```

7 LAYER MODEL OF NETWORKING

```
USED BY STUDENTS AND REAL-WORLD ENGINEERS!

LAYER 1 PHYSICAL

	SENDING OUT ELECTICAL PULSES

	WIRE : COPPER OR FIBER

	WIFI : WIFI SIGNAL

	ENCODE : SEND DATA OUT IN FORMAT SO IT CAN 
		GET FROM A TO B WITHOUT LOSING 
		DEFINITION OF SIGNAL

	PHYSICAL NETWORK PORT

LAYER 2 DATA LINK

	LOCAL LAN TRAFFIC

	EACH DEVICE HAS A UNIQUE ADDRESS CALLED A 'MAC
	ADDRESS'

		MAC = MEDIA ACCESS CONTROL

	EACH MAC ADDRESS IS UNIQUE

		2 PARTS : COMPANY ID + UNIQUE PART

			  (( OUI ))

	VIEW MAC ADDRESS ==> IPCONFIG /ALL

LAYER 3 NETWORK

	LAYER 1  : PHYSICAL
	LAYER 2  : LOCAL ADDRESSES (LAN ONLY)

	LAYER 3  : GLOBAL ADDRESSING SCHEME VALID ACROSS
		   ENTIRE WORLD : UNIQUE ADDRESSES IDENTIFY
		   COMPUTERS

		   EG GOOGLE SERVER AT 173.194.116.193

	ROUTERS ALSO WORK HERE

		TALK TO OTHER ROUTERS : CREATE PATHS
		ACROSS THE WORLD FOR FASTEST WAY TO GET
		DATA FROM A TO B

		CREATE 'ROUTING TABLE' OF BEST ROUTES

		DATA COMES IN ==> DATA SENT DOWN BEST ROUTE
		

LAYER 4 TRANSPORT

	LAYER 3 : IP PACKETS  BUT PROBLEM WITH THEM IS THAT

		- LIKE A REGULAR POSTMAN - THERE IS NO 
			RECORD OF DELIVERY 

	LAYER 4 : TCP TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL

		- COUNT AND CHECK ALL PACKETS IN AND OUT

		==> SENDING : OUT : USE A 'SEQ' SEQUENCE NUMBER

		==> CONFIRMING RECEIPT : USE AN 'ACK'
				ACKNOWLEDGEMENT NUMBER

			SEND : SEQ : 3,4,5,6,7
			       ACK : 3,4,6, 7

			ACK PACKETS SENT BACK TO ORIGINAL 
			SENDER.  SENDER FLAGGED THAT PACKET
			5 HAS GONE MISSING

			PACKET 5 RESENT!!!

		" BETTER SLOW DATA THAN NO DATA "

			TCP IS SLOWER BUT PEACE OF MIND
			DATA IS ACTUALLY ARRIVING

		TCP : CHECKS

		UDP : USED WHERE NO CHECKING REQUIRED

			(BLANK, DUMMY PROTOCOL)

			UDP ==> VERY FAST!!
		
			EG STREAMING RADIO STATION

LAYER 5 SESSION

	CREATES AND MANAGES 'SESSIONS' OR 'STREAMS OF TRAFFIC'

	EG SKYPE + EMAIL + TEXT CHAT + BROWSE INTERNET : ALL
		TRAFFIC GETS PUT TO THE CORRECT APPLICATION

	EG MULTIPLE TABS ON A BROWSER

LAYER 6 PRESENTATION

	COMPRESS DATA

		EG WAV (UNCOMPRESSED) ==> MP3/WEBM
	
	ENCRYPT DATA

LAYER 7 APPLICATION

	PROGRAM WHICH IS REQUESTING ACCESS TO NETWORK
	EG OUTLOOK OR SKYPE ETC

```

SWITCHES

```
LAYER 2 DEVICE

FILTER ALL TRAFFIC USING 'MAC ADDRESS' OF EVERY DEVICE
	ATTACHED

BUILD UP A 'SWITCHING TABLE' OF ALL CONNECTED DEVICES

PORT		MAC ADDRESS

1		30-85-A9-9A-6B-B5
2		00-50-56-C0-00-01
3		00-50-56-C0-00-08

ETHERNET PACKET GETS SENT FROM A DEVICE TO SWITCH

|-----data--------------|SOURCE MAC |  DESTINATION MAC |
				       00-50-56-C0-00-08

			|---------header---------------|

	==> SWITCH CHECKS TABLE AND IN THIS INSTANCE
		FINDS A MATCH ON PORT 3 SO WILL FORWARD
		ETHERNET PACKET TO DEVICE ON PORT 3

IEEE 802.3 ==> ETHERNET STANDARD 

```

CABLE SPEEDS

```
CAT 3		10Mbps
CAT 5		100Mbps     *** FAST ETHERNET ***
CAT 5E		1000Mbps
CAT 6		10000Mbps
POE		DELIVERS POWER DOWN WIRE AS WELL AS SIGNAL

		POE = POWER OVER ETHERNET

```

ACCESS POINT

```
WIFI ACCESS POINT IS AN AERIAL CONNECTED TO WIRED NETWORK
	WHEREBY WIRELESS DEVICES CAN TALK TO WIRED NETWORK

TODAY : ROAMING WIRELESS WITH MULTIPLE POINTS FOR 
			CONVENIENCE

```

MODEM

```
MODEM = 'MODULATE-DEMODULATE'

	MODULATE : SEND A DIGITAL SIGNAL ONTO AN ANALOGUE
			WIRE AS A WAVE SIGNAL

	PC (1011000)====>MODEM====>PHONE LINE (WAVE)

	 DIGITAL                    ANALOGUE

	DEMODULATE = RETURN BACK TO DIGITAL SIGNAL

```

IP ADDRESS : PORT

```
EACH IP ADDRESS IS LIKE A SECURE CASTLE WITH 65536 SECURE
	ENTRY POINTS

	YOU CAN'T SEND DATA INTO THIS DEVICE WITHOUT 		
	USING ONE OF THESE CHANNELS

	EG WEB TRAFFIC : HTTP : USES PORT 80 (EVEN IF NOT 
					STATED)		

			 HTTPS : USES PORT 443

	SEND EMAIL : USE SMTP PROTOCOL : USES PORT 25

	FTP DOWNLOAD : USES PORT 20/21

	REMOTE DESKTOP : 3389

PORTS 1-1000    FIXED BY NETWORKING OFFICIAL USES

PORTS 1000+     CAN BE USED BY ANYONE!

	EG GAMERS!!!

```

FIREWALL

```
BLOCK OR PERMIT ALL IP TRAFFIC GOING INTO AND OUT OF 
	YOUR ROUTER

	FILTER ON 

		IP ADDRESS AND PORT NUMBER

		EG *:22 WILL BLOCK ALL TRAFFIC FROM 
			ALL IP ADDRESSES ON PORT 22 (SSH)

		   1.2.3.4:22 PERMIT ALL

```

PATCH PANEL

```
PC ==> PLUG INTO WALL ==> ALL WIRES GO BEHIND WALL AND
	       MEET AT ONE POINT.

	PATCH PANEL TAKES RAW WIRES AT THIS POINT

	AND WIRES THEM UP

NETWORKING : TCP/IP

```
WHAT'S THE POINT OF TCP/IP???

	COLD WAR : RUSSIA VS US

	GOAL WAS TO CREATE A ROBUST NETWORK WITH FOLLOWING
		CHARACTERISTICS

	1) NODES WERE INDEPENDENT AND NOT CENTRALLY MANAGED

	2) TRAFFIC GETS FROM A TO B WITH ROUTING AGAIN 
		NOT DICTACTED CENTRALLY BUT LOCAL 
		ROUTING DECISIONS TAKEN 'AUTONOMOUSLY'

	GOAL WAS TO CREATE A ROBUST NETWORK THAT COULD
	AUTOMATICALLY SURVIVE A NUCLEAR WAR WITH WHOLE 
	CITIES GOING OUT.  NETWORK WOULD SURVIVE AND RE-ROUTE
	ON SURVIVING NODES

ROUTABLE PROTOCOL : CAN SEND DATA ROUND WORLD

	NON-ROUTABLE PROTOCOLS ARE LOCAL LAN ONLY

		EG 

			ETHERNET
			NETBIOS   (USES HOST NAME ONLY)
			APPLETALK

ELECTRICITY

```
WHAT IS ELECTRICITY???

FLOW OF ELECTRONS INSIDE A WIRE FROM A TO B

WHAT DRIVES ELECTRICITY???

VOLTAGE IS LIKE PRESSURE IN A WATER PIPE : HIGH VOLTAGE 
	IS LIKE A HIGH-PRESSURE HOSE AND CAUSES HIGH
	CURRENT

	+600V  <<<<=====ELECTRONS MOVE TOWARDS THE POSITIVE	

VOLTAGE IS ELECTRICAL PRESSURE

	VOLTS

CURRENT IS FLOW OF ELECTRONS

	AMPS

RESISTANCE IS HOW WELL OR POORLY THE ITEM LETS CURRENT FLOW

	METAL - GOOD

	PLASTIC - BAD
	
	OHMS

VOLTS = CURRENT X RESISTANCE    V=IR
	

	
POWER = ENERGY FLOWING

	POWER = VOLT X CURRENT

		WATTS

```

POWER ISSUES

```
NOISE

	RANDOM FLUCTUATIONS IN CURRENT (ALWAYS PRESENT)

DIP = SAG

	DROP IN CURRENT

BROWNOUT

	POWER DROPS NORMALLY FOR GOOD FEW SECONDS OR MORE

BLACKOUT

	NO POWER !  (1/2 SECOND OR MORE!)

SURGE

	CIRCUIT : EG FLICK A SWITCH AND CURRENT SUDDENLY
		CHANGES

SPIKE

	EG LIGHTNING HITS, VERY HIGH INCREASE IN VOLTAGE

		==> BLOW YOUR CIRCUITS !!!

CONDITIONING

	CLEAN POWER SIGNAL AND REMOVE ALL NON-SMOOTH ELEMENTS

	UNINTERRUPTIBLE POWER SUPPLY

```

RAM

```
SIMM = SINGLE-SIDED RAM

ONE RAM STICK HAS 8 'BANKS' OR CHIPS ON IT!

DIMM = (CURRENT) RAM = DOUBLE SIDED

SDRAM = MUST BE CONTINUOUSLY REFRESHED TO KEEP DATA ALIVE

	(SYNCHRONOUS DYNAMIC RAM)	

DDR   DOUBLE DATA RATE (X2 SPEED)

DDR2 X4

DDR3 X8     (2 TO THE POWER OF 3 = 2X2X2=8)

PARITY RAM : HAS A 9TH (CHECKING) BIT

	1010 1010   1

		   
		1010 1010  ==> RUN CALCULATION, GET 1 OR 0

ECC ERROR CORRECTING CODE

	DETECT AND FIX MEMORY ERRORS

NOTE!!! PARITY AND ECC RAM ARE SLOW!!!!!!!!

	DON'T USE EXCEPT ON CRITICAL SERVER !!!!

SRAM = STATIC RAM == FAST, EXPENSIVE RAM USED ONLY IN CPU
		AS NORMAL SDRAM IS FAR TOO SLOW

	SRAM MADE EG OF GOLD, VERY EXPENSIVE

```

RAID

```
RAID 0   FAST, N DRIVES BUT NO RECOVERY

RAID 1	2 DRIVES 'MIRRORED' IE COPIES OF EACH OTHER

	INK IS FIRED USING A MINI PUMP WHICH EXPANDS OR
		CONTRACTS USING ELECTRICITY 

			PIEZO-ELECTRIC EFFECT

CHEAP AND TEND TO BE THROW-AWAY IF FOUND FAULTY
		
CHEAP TO BUY

EXPENSIVE TO RUN BECAUSE..INK IS LOW YIELD...

```

THERMAL PRINTER

```
CHEAP TO RUN

ONLY THING YOU ACTUALLY USE IS THE PAPER!!!

PAPER IS HEAT SENSITIVE AND JUST 'BURNS' AND GOES BLACK
	TO PRODUCE VERY CRUDE BLACK-ON-WHITE TEXT FOR
	EG RECEIPT.

```

IMPACT PRINTER

```
CHEAP TO RUN

ONLY USE PAPER WHICH GETS FED THROUGH USING A 

	'TRACTOR FEED'

RIBBON HAS THE INK

PINS HIT RIBBON AND MAKE MARK ON PAPER

	9 PIN = DRAFT (FAST)

	24 PIN = DETAILED (SLOWER)

GOOD FOR LETTING YOUR PRINTER PRINT ALL NIGHT EG LONG 
	ACCOUNTING / STOCK REPORTS EG MONTH-END FOR
	PAPER ARCHIVE

GOOD FOR CARBON COPY

LASER PRINT CYCLE

1. CLEANING DRUM

	A) PHYSICAL CLEAN OF ANY RESIDUAL TONER LEFT OVER

		RUBBER BLADE
		
	B) TAKE OFF ANY EXCESS CHARGE, BRING DOWN TO ZERO

2.CHARGE UP DRUM TO 600VOLTS 

	WIRE : PRIMARY CORONA WIRE

3. WRITING THE IMAGE : USING A LASER WE 'PAINT' THE IMAGE
	ELECTROSTATICALLY ON THE CHARGED DRUM

		LASER HITS : CHARGE WILL DROP

4. DEVELOPING : ATTRACT SOME TONER ONTO THE DRUM

	HIGH CHARGE : TONER IS ATTRACTED
	LOW CHARGE  : LESS ATTRACTION SO LESS TONER

5. TRANSFER : USE A CHARGED WIRE TO TRANSFER ALL TONER
		ON TO A SHEET OF PAPER

	WIRE : SECONDARY CORONA WIRE

6. FUSING : MELT OR FUSE TONER ONTO PAPER 

	WIRE : FUSER WIRE AT 300 CELSIUS

CONSUMABLES : 4 COLOUR TONERS CMYK CYAN MAGENTA YELLOW BLACK
