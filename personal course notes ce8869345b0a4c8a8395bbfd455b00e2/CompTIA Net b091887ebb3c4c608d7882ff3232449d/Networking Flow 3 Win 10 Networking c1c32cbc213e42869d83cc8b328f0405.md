Network models

```
Domain

	Central server = DOMAIN CONTROLLER

		Clients 'join' the domain and come under
		the umbrella of central security

		MULTIMASTER = MANY DOMAIN CONTROLLERS, ALL
		FULFILLING SAME FUNCTION 

		ACTIVE DIRECTORY = PROGRAM IN WINDOWS TO
		CREATE A DOMAIN AND RUN A DOMAIN CONTROLLER

		PERMANENT : CLIENTS JOIN AND STAY JOINED

Client - Server  relationship

	EG LOG IN TO OUR BANK

PEER-TO-PEER NETWORK

	WINDOWS CLIENTS ON SAME NETWORK BUT NO CENTRAL 
			SERVER TO MANAGE THEM

		NO CENTRAL SECURITY
		NO BACKUPS ...

		OK FOR HOME OR SMALL OFFICE 

			SOHO = SMALL OFFICE, HOME OFFICE

	'WORKGROUP' = WINDOWS PEER-TO-PEER NETWORK

```

LAN LOCAL AREA NETWORK

```
PC

SWITCH  (CENTRAL DEVICE)

SERVER

WIFI

ROUTER (TO INTERNET)

```

WAN WIDE AREA NETWORK

```
LAN1 + ROUTER ---> DIAL UP --> ISP

	ISP = INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER

	ISP --> ROUTER --> CONNECT TO FAST PART OF INTERNET

		CALLED 'BACKBONE' OF INTERNET

	==> CONNECT EG TO ANOTHER LAN IN ANOTHER COUNTRY

			    VPN
LAN1===across internet--((encrypt))====LAN2

```

PAN PERSONAL AREA NETWORK : BLUETOOTH NETWORK

MAN METROPOLITAN AREA NETWORK : ACROSS A CITY

```
UNIVERSITY CAMPUS

HOSPITAL DIVERSE BUILDINGS

ARMY GARRISON

BANKS WITHIN A CITY???

```

VPN VIRTUAL PRIVATE NETWORK

```
	LAN 1	     |    INTERNET         |   LAN 2
			   
PC - SWITCH - ROUTER1 ======VPN_TUNNEL=====ROUTER2--->LAN2  

|---unencrypted-----|-----encrypted--------|---unencrypted

AT ROUTER, 'DIAL UP' TO ANOTHER IP ADDRESS (THIS WOULD
	BE ANOTHER ROUTER).  SET OUR ENCRYPTION.
	CREATE 'TUNNEL' TO SEND DATA, ENCRYPTED, TO THAT
	OTHER IP ADDRESS.

DIAL-UP

	PPP
	PPPoE

VPN
	PPTP
	L2TP
	SSTP
	IKEV2

```

NETWORK COMPONENTS

HUB

```
FIRST EVER NETWORKS CREATED USED HUBS

PURELY FORWARD ELECTICITY ARRIVING AT ONE PORT, 
SEND OUT SAME PULSES ON ALL OTHER PORTS

---->IN---HUB===> OUT (SAME SIGNAL)

THIS WAS GOOD FOR SMALL NETWORKS.

TODAY HUBS ARE TERRIBLE.

	BECAUSE ==> BROADCAST TRAFFIC TO ALL DEVICES ALWAYS

		CREATE 'NOISE' ON NETWORK

	((UNICAST = 1-1))
	((BROADCAST = 1 TO MANY))		

SPEED OF HUB = 10Mbps

BUT DECREASES WITH N DEVICES TO 1/N SPEED

10 DEVICES ==> 1/10 SPEED (AT BEST)

```

BRIDGE

```
OLD, WAS USED TO CONNECT DIFFERENT TYPES OF NETWORKS

	EG TOKEN RING FROM IBM TO ETHERNET

	(WORKS AT LAYER 2)

```

REPEATER

```
LIKE HUB 

ONLY GOT 2 PORTS 

JUST USED TO EXTEND LENGTH OF A NETWORK

EG

ETHERNET 100M MAX LENGTH

	100M : REPEATER : 100M 

	-----200m total-------

	
5-4-3 rule : 5 NETWORKS WITH 4 REPEATERS BUT ONLY 3 CAN 
		HAVE COMPUTERS IN THEM!

```

FIRST NETWORKS

```
10 MBPS  : USED THICK COAX CABLE CALLED 'THICKNET'  

THEN

10 MBPS  : THINNET (STILL COAX) - LIKE TV CABLE TODAY

THEN

ETHERNET : 10/100/1000/10000 MBPS TODAY!!!

```

7 LAYER MODEL OF NETWORKING

```
PHYSICAL

	GETTING SIGNAL FROM PC TO NEXT DEVICE

		COPPER : ETHERNET OR COAX (TV)
		WIFI   : 
		LIGHT  : FIBER OPTIC
		

DATA LINK

	DATA ROUND LAN???

		MAC ADDRESS  

			SHOW WITH IPCONFIG /ALL    OR  GETMAC

			AA-BB-CC-DD-EE-FF  

			EACH CHARACTER REPRESENTS 4 BITS
			TOTAL = 4 X 12 = 48 BITS LONG ADDRESS

			FIRST HALF : OUI 

		ETHERNET PROTOCOL USES 'FRAMES'

					     |  HEADER------------->
		|CRC|---DATA-----------------| SOURCE MAC | DEST MAC|

		JOB OF SWITCH 

			LOOK AT DESTINATION MAC : LOOKUP IF THIS
			MAC ADDRESS IS ATTACHED TO SWITCH.  SEND.
			'VIRTUAL CIRCUIT'

```

7 LAYER MODEL OF NETWORKING

```
USED BY STUDENTS AND REAL-WORLD ENGINEERS!

LAYER 1 PHYSICAL

	SENDING OUT ELECTICAL PULSES

	WIRE : COPPER OR FIBER

	WIFI : WIFI SIGNAL

	ENCODE : SEND DATA OUT IN FORMAT SO IT CAN 
		GET FROM A TO B WITHOUT LOSING 
		DEFINITION OF SIGNAL

	PHYSICAL NETWORK PORT

LAYER 2 DATA LINK

	LOCAL LAN TRAFFIC

	EACH DEVICE HAS A UNIQUE ADDRESS CALLED A 'MAC
	ADDRESS'

		MAC = MEDIA ACCESS CONTROL

	EACH MAC ADDRESS IS UNIQUE

		2 PARTS : COMPANY ID + UNIQUE PART

			  (( OUI ))

	VIEW MAC ADDRESS ==> IPCONFIG /ALL

LAYER 3 NETWORK

	LAYER 1  : PHYSICAL
	LAYER 2  : LOCAL ADDRESSES (LAN ONLY)

	LAYER 3  : GLOBAL ADDRESSING SCHEME VALID ACROSS
		   ENTIRE WORLD : UNIQUE ADDRESSES IDENTIFY
		   COMPUTERS

		   EG GOOGLE SERVER AT 173.194.116.193

```

LAYER 2 : LAN ADDRESS : MAC ADDRESS : PHYSICAL ADDRESS : ETHERNET PROTOCOL

LAYER 3 : GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE

```
MAC ADDRESS : VALID ON LAN ONLY

IP ADDRESS : VALID GLOBALLY (IF YOU PAY FOR ONE!) 

	PRIVATE IP : FREE, INTERNAL USE

		10.X.Y.Z, 172.16-172.31.Y.Z , 192.168.X.Y

		(( APIPA   169.254.X.Y  ==> DHCP NOT WORKING))

	ROUTERS ALSO WORK HERE

		TALK TO OTHER ROUTERS : CREATE PATHS
		ACROSS THE WORLD FOR FASTEST WAY TO GET
		DATA FROM A TO B

		CREATE 'ROUTING TABLE' OF BEST ROUTES

		DATA COMES IN ==> DATA SENT DOWN BEST ROUTE

```

ROUTING PROTOCOLS

```
ROUTERS TALK TO EACH OTHER.  THEY SHARE INFORMATION ABOUT THE
	ROUTES THAT THEY KNOW ABOUT.  THEY USE THIS TO 
	BUILD 'BEST ROUTES' ROUND THE INTERNET

ROUTING PROTOCOL IS A LANGUAGE THAT ROUTERS USE TO TALK 
	TO EACH OTHER

RIP   ROUTING INFORMATION PROTOCOL

	OLDEST PROTOCOL

	'BROADCAST' BASED ==> WHOLE ROUTING TABLE GETS
	SENT OUT TO ALL ROUTERS EVERY 30 SECONDS	

	(EVEN IF NO CHANGES HAVE BEEN MADE)

METRIC = WAY TO MEASURE STUFF

	MEASURES DISTANCE IN 'HOPS'

	ONE HOP = ONE ROUTER 'BOUNCE' ALONG THE WAY

	BEST ROUTES CHOSEN WITH LOWEST 'HOP' COUNT

EIGRP

	CISCO : SIMILAR BUT FASTER AND ONLY SEND OUT DATA
	IF CHANGES ARE PRESENT

OSPF

	DIVIDES THE WORLD INTO 'AREAS' LIKE CONTINENTS AND
	COUNTRIES.  SEND DATA TO AN AREA, THEN SUB-AREA ETC

	AUSTRALASIA => AUSTRALIA => WEST => MELBOURNE 
		==> STREET => HOUSE NUMBER

BGP
	BACKBONE OF INTERNET (FAST)
	
	
	
	
	
	
LAYER 4 TRANSPORT

	LAYER 3 : IP PACKETS  BUT PROBLEM WITH THEM IS THAT

		- LIKE A REGULAR POSTMAN - THERE IS NO 
			RECORD OF DELIVERY 

		"CONNECTIONLESS" 

	LAYER 4 : TCP TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL

		- COUNT AND CHECK ALL PACKETS IN AND OUT

		==> SENDING : OUT : USE A 'SEQ' SEQUENCE NUMBER

		==> CONFIRMING RECEIPT : USE AN 'ACK'
				ACKNOWLEDGEMENT NUMBER

			SEND : SEQ : 3,4,5,6,7
			       ACK : 3,4,6, 7

			ACK PACKETS SENT BACK TO ORIGINAL 
			SENDER.  SENDER FLAGGED THAT PACKET
			5 HAS GONE MISSING

			PACKET 5 RESENT!!!

		" BETTER SLOW DATA THAN NO DATA "

			TCP IS SLOWER BUT PEACE OF MIND
			DATA IS ACTUALLY ARRIVING

		TCP : CHECKS

		UDP : USED WHERE NO CHECKING REQUIRED

			(BLANK, DUMMY PROTOCOL)

			UDP ==> VERY FAST!!
		
			EG STREAMING RADIO STATION

LAYER 5 SESSION

	CREATES AND MANAGES 'SESSIONS' OR 'STREAMS OF TRAFFIC'

	EG SKYPE + EMAIL + TEXT CHAT + BROWSE INTERNET : ALL
		TRAFFIC GETS PUT TO THE CORRECT APPLICATION

	EG MULTIPLE TABS ON A BROWSER

LAYER 6 PRESENTATION

	COMPRESS DATA

		EG WAV (UNCOMPRESSED) ==> MP3/WEBM
	
	ENCRYPT DATA

LAYER 7 APPLICATION

	PROGRAM WHICH IS REQUESTING ACCESS TO NETWORK
	EG OUTLOOK OR SKYPE ETC

```

SWITCHES

```
LAYER 2 DEVICE

FILTER ALL TRAFFIC USING 'MAC ADDRESS' OF EVERY DEVICE
	ATTACHED

BUILD UP A 'SWITCHING TABLE' OF ALL CONNECTED DEVICES

PORT		MAC ADDRESS

1		30-85-A9-9A-6B-B5
2		00-50-56-C0-00-01
3		00-50-56-C0-00-08

ETHERNET PACKET GETS SENT FROM A DEVICE TO SWITCH

|-----data--------------|SOURCE MAC |  DESTINATION MAC |
				       00-50-56-C0-00-08

			|---------header---------------|

	==> SWITCH CHECKS TABLE AND IN THIS INSTANCE
		FINDS A MATCH ON PORT 3 SO WILL FORWARD
		ETHERNET PACKET TO DEVICE ON PORT 3

IEEE 802.3 ==> ETHERNET STANDARD 

```

CABLE SPEEDS

```
CAT 3		10Mbps
CAT 5		100Mbps     *** FAST ETHERNET ***
CAT 5E		1000Mbps
CAT 6		10000Mbps
POE		DELIVERS POWER DOWN WIRE AS WELL AS SIGNAL

		POE = POWER OVER ETHERNET

```

ACCESS POINT

```
WIFI ACCESS POINT IS AN AERIAL CONNECTED TO WIRED NETWORK
	WHEREBY WIRELESS DEVICES CAN TALK TO WIRED NETWORK

TODAY : ROAMING WIRELESS WITH MULTIPLE POINTS FOR 
			CONVENIENCE

```

MODEM

```
MODEM = 'MODULATE-DEMODULATE'

	MODULATE : SEND A DIGITAL SIGNAL ONTO AN ANALOGUE
			WIRE AS A WAVE SIGNAL

	PC (1011000)====>MODEM====>PHONE LINE (WAVE)

	 DIGITAL                    ANALOGUE

	DEMODULATE = RETURN BACK TO DIGITAL SIGNAL

```

IP ADDRESS : PORT

```
EACH IP ADDRESS IS LIKE A SECURE CASTLE WITH 65536 SECURE
	ENTRY POINTS

	YOU CAN'T SEND DATA INTO THIS DEVICE WITHOUT 		
	USING ONE OF THESE CHANNELS

	EG WEB TRAFFIC : HTTP : USES PORT 80 (EVEN IF NOT 
					STATED)		

			 HTTPS : USES PORT 443

	SEND EMAIL : USE SMTP PROTOCOL : USES PORT 25

	FTP DOWNLOAD : USES PORT 20/21

	REMOTE DESKTOP : 3389

PORTS 1-1000    FIXED BY NETWORKING OFFICIAL USES

PORTS 1000+     CAN BE USED BY ANYONE!

	EG GAMERS!!!

```

FIREWALL

```
BLOCK OR PERMIT ALL IP TRAFFIC GOING INTO AND OUT OF 
	YOUR ROUTER

	FILTER ON 

		IP ADDRESS AND PORT NUMBER

		EG *:22 WILL BLOCK ALL TRAFFIC FROM 
			ALL IP ADDRESSES ON PORT 22 (SSH)

		   1.2.3.4:22 PERMIT ALL

```

PATCH PANEL

```
PC ==> PLUG INTO WALL ==> ALL WIRES GO BEHIND WALL AND
	       MEET AT ONE POINT.

	PATCH PANEL TAKES RAW WIRES AT THIS POINT

	AND WIRES THEM UP 	

PUNCHDOWN BLOCK

```

SERVER ROLES

```
FILE SERVER 

	SHARES: CLIENTS READ/WRITE FILES

	   VSS VOLUME SHADOW COPY : CAN GET PAST VERSIONS
		IN CASE YOU MAKE A MISTAKE

ACTIVE DIRECTORY : SECURITY EG AUTHENTICATION

DNS

```
DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM

	user types 'myfavsite.org'  ==>  Computer does 'DNS Lookup'
		to DNS Server configured Control Panel Networking or

MAP FRIENDLY NAME EG INTEL.COM TO AN IP ADDRESS 1.2.3.4

	COMPUTERS ONLY USE IP ADDRESSES TO TALK	

	MAP EG WWW.INTEL.COM ==> 1.2.3.4

NSLOOKUP GOOGLE.COM  ==> TELL US ALL OF GOOGLE'S DNS

NETWORKING : TCP/IP

```
WHAT'S THE POINT OF TCP/IP???

	COLD WAR : RUSSIA VS US

	GOAL WAS TO CREATE A ROBUST NETWORK WITH FOLLOWING
		CHARACTERISTICS

	1) NODES WERE INDEPENDENT AND NOT CENTRALLY MANAGED

	2) TRAFFIC GETS FROM A TO B WITH ROUTING AGAIN 
		NOT DICTACTED CENTRALLY BUT LOCAL 
		ROUTING DECISIONS TAKEN 'AUTONOMOUSLY'

	GOAL WAS TO CREATE A ROBUST NETWORK THAT COULD
	AUTOMATICALLY SURVIVE A NUCLEAR WAR WITH WHOLE 
	CITIES GOING OUT.  NETWORK WOULD SURVIVE AND RE-ROUTE
	ON SURVIVING NODES

ROUTABLE PROTOCOL : CAN SEND DATA ROUND WORLD

	NON-ROUTABLE PROTOCOLS ARE LOCAL LAN ONLY

		EG 

			ETHERNET
			NETBIOS   (USES HOST NAME ONLY)
			APPLETALK

BINARY NUMBERING

BINARY HAS ONLY 1 OR 0 FOR ALL NUMBERS

	THEREFORE CAN WRITE THE SAME THING AS /24

	CIDR NOTATION IS 1.2.3.4/24 MEANS 255.255.255.0

	ALL CLIENTS HAVE PRIVATE IP

	AT NAT ROUTER : PRIVATE IP SWAPPED OUT AND PUBLIC
			IP IS PUT INTO THE PACKETS

RESULT : INTERNAL COMPUTERS HAVE PRIVATE IP BUT CAN STILL
		ACCESS PUBLIC INTERNET	

	172.16.20.98  ==>  ROUTER : GETS SWAPPED FOR WHAT IP ???

```

DMZ = DE-MILITARIZED ZONE = PERIMITER NETWORK

```
PUBLIC FACING WEBSITE

	HOST THIS OUTSIDE YOUR LAN
		
		
	PRIVATE LAN 
		SECURE LAN FIREWALL
			ROUTER

						PUBLIC FACING WEBSERVER ON DMZ NETWORK
							PORTS 80,443 OPEN TO PUBLIC TRAFFIC
							
    NOT SECURE!								
			
	LAN      WEBSERVER	ROUTER				INTERNET BAD BOY

NAC NETWORK ACCESS CONTROL

```
USED TO 

	1) AUTHENTICATE USERS (WHO WANT ACCESS FROM OUTSIDE)
			EG VPN

	2) ENSURE HEALTH OF MACHINES (CONNECTING FROM 
			OUTSIDE) EG VPN

		A) AV RUNNING, UP TO DATE
		B) FIREWALL
		C) AV SCAN - RECENT?
		D) ADWARE/SPYWARE SCAN?
		E) WINDOWS UP TO DATE?

<< WINDOWS : CALLED NAP NETWORK ACCESS PROTECTION >>

```

CLOUD AND INTERNET

```
LOCAL NETWORK : HIGH COSTS WITH BUYING LOTS OF HARDWARE
	EG CABLES, SERVERS, SWITCHES, ROUTERS, FIREWALLS,
	ELECTRICITY, COOLING, SECURE ROOMS

		BACKUP!!!

		SITE STAFF COSTS & TRAINING !!!

		SECURITY!!!

SOME COSTS BEST OFFLOADED TO REMOTE SITE FOR OTHERS TO 
	TAKE HEADACHE OF INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS

	COSTLY TO RUN IN CLOUD !!!

	BUT ADVANTAGES ARE : 

		DON'T NEED SPACE!
		DATA AVAILABLE GLOBALLY
		SECURE (ENCRYPTED)
		MAINTENANCE BY PROFESSIONALS
		BACKUP AUTOMATIC (ACROSS GLOBE)

PERMISSIONS

```
WINDOWS : PERMISSION SETTINGS CALLED 'NTFS'

			NT = NEW TECHNOLOGY (1995)
			FS = FILING SYSTEM

	ACL = ACCESS CONTROL LIST .. OF USERS
	ACE = ENTRY IN ACL   LIST .. OF PERMISSIONS

	NTFS PERMISSIONS

		FULL CONTROL    CAN SET PERMISSIONS

		MODIFY		CHANGE DATA (NOT PERMISSIONS)

		READ 		

		EXECUTE		RUN .EXE 

		WRITE		ADD BUT NOT MODIFY

		LIST/TRAVERSE FOLDERS  VIEW FOLDER

SHARE PERMISSIONS 

		WEAK; NOT USED MUCH FOR SECURITY

		FULL CONTROL
		CHANGE
		READ

	SHARE : UNC PATH TO REACH SHARE

		\\\\server_name\\share_name

		\\\\ip_address\\share_name

		server_name = HOSTNAME = NAME OF MACHINE

			1) MY COMPUTER => PROPERTIES
			2) HOSTNAME

			EG MY HOSTNAME IS .. 2301-377179

		FULL SHARE NAME IS \\\\2301-377179\\SHARE

		USING IP IT IS \\\\192.168.1.13\\SHARE
		
		
		client=============>share (read)============>folder (NTFS FULL CONTROL)
		

			ANSWER : READ ACCESS

FILE ATTRIBUTES

```
EVERY FILE HAS SOME EXTRA 'TAGS' CALLED ATTRIBUTES

	- HIDDEN

		EXISTS BUT DOES NOT APPEAR NORMALLY

	- SYSTEM

		CRITICAL WINDOWS FILE

	- ARCHIVE

		0 ==> FILE HAS NOT CHANGED
		1 ==> FILE HAS CHANGED (BACKUP PROGRAM
			 WILL DETECT THIS AND STORE
				CHANGES)

	- READ ONLY

		

	- INDEX

		WINDOWS INDEXES FILE FOR FAST FINDING

ATTRIB COMMAND

	-H HIDDEN
	-S SYSTEM
	-A ARCHIVE
	-R READ ONLY

	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	

SERIAL LINE

	ORIGINAL COMPUTERS HAD A 'SERIAL PORT'

		WITH 9 PINS

	RS232 PORT = SERIAL PORT

	(( COMPUTER ==>

EXAM PROBLEM WITH MASK /27

WORK IT OUT THIS WAY

11111111 	11111111    11111111   111 00000

NOTE : /27 MEANS IN LAST OCTET 

	FIVE ZEROS FOR PCS

	QUESTION : HOW MANY COMPUTERS CAN WE FIT HERE???

	2 TO THE POWER 5 IS 32 (BUT SUBTRACT 2) 

MAGIC NUMBER : NETWORK JUMP WILL BE EVERY 32 PLACES
	FIRST NETWORK ....32
	SECOND           .64
            3RD               96
			  
	8TH               224  

	8 NETWORKS 

WORK THIS OUT BECAUSE 2 TO THE POWER 3 ==> 8

<http://jodies.de/ipcalc>

```

1111 0000
Questions : HOW MANY COMPUTERS PER NETWORK?? 2 TO THE POWER 4 = 16-2=14
WHAT THEN IS THE 'NETWORK BOUNCE' IE THE SEQUENCE OF NUMBERS
OF THE ALLOWED NETWORKS? 0,16,32,64,96..
HOW MANY NETWORKS? 16 (2 TO POWER 4)
SECOND NETWORK ID? 16
SECOND NETWORK BROADCAST ADDRESS?

AUTHENTICATION

```
SOMETHING YOU ...

		KNOW (PASSWORD)
		HAVE (CARD)
		ARE  (BIOMETRIC)

```

SECURITY

```
TWO-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION
	
	EG CARD + USER/PASSWORD
	OR USER/PASS + IP VERIFICATION

TOKEN

	ELECTRONIC KEY ISSUED TO YOU ONCE AUTHENTICATED

KERBEROS

	ENCRYPTION AND SECURITY USED FOR ACTIVE DIRECTORY

MUTUAL AUTHENTICATION

	MACHINES : EG SERVER-SERVER

	802.1X : MACHINE-TO-MACHINE TRUST
	CERTIFICATES INSTALLED ON EACH MACHINE
		GENERATE LEVELS OF TRUST

	(CERTIFICATE : DIGITAL PASSPORT)

SSO

	SINGLE SIGN-ON

TKIP

	ENCRYPTION AT SAME TIME AS VISTA ==> WRONG ANSWER

EAP

	CURRENT ENCRYPTION STANDARD

	(( SHELL INSIDE WHICH OTHER SECURITY MECHANISMS ))

	USE WITH WIRELESS LOGIN 

	USER=> AUTHENTICATE ==> WIFI ROUTER ==> CONNECTED
				TO 'RADIUS' ==> 
				         ACTIVE DIRECTORY

AES 

	CURRENT ENCRYPTION STANDARD

ENCRYPTION : GARBLING UP TEXT

TWO TYPES OF ENCRYPTION

	SHARED : SYMMETRIC KEY

	CLIENT ===> SEND DATA ==> KEY ABCDEFG TO ENCRYPT

		===> RECEIVE DATA ==> KEY ABCDEFG TO DECRYPT

		ONE KEY WHICH DOES THE 

			-ENCRYPTION

			-DECRYPTION			

		COMMON IN

			WIFI

			EFS ENCRYPTION IN WINDOWS
				(PASSWORD IS KEY)

			'SESSION' ONLINE (BANKING)
			  (SHORT TERM)

		INHERENTLY INSECURE BECAUSE ONE KEY 
			DOING BOTH THINGS (ENCRYPT/DECRYPT)	

		EXAM : WEP OLD
		       WPA NEW GOOD

	PKI PUBLIC/PRIVATE KEY PAIR	

		TWO KEYS 
			ONE : ENCRYPT
			OTHER : DECRYPT

		VERY SECURE : USED IN ALL BUSINESS TODAY

	CERTIFICATE

		DIGITAL KEY ISSUED TO USER / COMPUTER

		IT IS THE 'PUBLIC' HALF OF KEY PAIR

	SIGNING

		FILE MYWORK.DOC

			1. CREATE A HASH FROM THE FILE

			2. ENCYRYPT THIS HASH USING OUR PRIVATE KEY

			COURT OF LAW : USE PUBLIC KEY TO DECRYPT HASH
				AND VERIFY INTEGRITY OF ORIGINAL FILE
				(RE-TAKE HASH AND CHECK OLD AND NEW HASHES 
				MATCH)

		SECURE BOOT	UEFI : FIRMWARE OF COMPUTER GETS 'SIGNED' AND
				KEYS STORED INSIDE 'TPM' CHIP

				BOOT COMPUTER ==> BOOT FILE INTEGRITY IS VALIDATES

					STOP  ROOTKIT INFECTION

		CREDENTIAL GUARD   : STORE CREDENTIALS IN SECURE 'VIRTUAL VALULT'
		DEVICE GUARD	   : APPS MUST BE SIGNED
		X64 		     DRIVERS MUST BE SIGNED
			
		

	WEB ENCRYPTION

		SSL ENCRYPT WEB TRANSACTIONS

		TLS : REPLACED SSL

		RELY ON CERTIFICATE ISSUED TO WEBSITE IN 
					ADVANCE

HASHING

	ONE-WAY ENCRYPTION

	TEXT STRING   ==> ALGORIGTHM ==>   ZK3FLKJPOIDFCFLKJ

	1) ONE-WAY : MATHEMATICALLY PROVEN YOU CAN'T REVERSE
		GET BACK TO ORIGINAL TEXT	

	2) HASHES ALL SAME LENGTH

	
	3) CHANGE ONE CHARACTER : HASH CHANGE UNRECOGNISABLY

TWO WAYS TODAY TO PRODUCE HASHES

	1) MD5  (older)

		MD5HASHGENERATOR.COM

	2) SHA1  (CURRENT, GOVERNMENT APPROVED EG US GOV)

	POWER OF HASHING IS WHAT???

	1) PASSWORDS : NEVER STORE A REAL PASSWORD - ONLY 
		STORE HASH OF ALL PASSWORDS IN DATABASE

			MYFAVPASSWORD ==> HASH AND STORE XLJASDFSA;LKJFDAS
```
