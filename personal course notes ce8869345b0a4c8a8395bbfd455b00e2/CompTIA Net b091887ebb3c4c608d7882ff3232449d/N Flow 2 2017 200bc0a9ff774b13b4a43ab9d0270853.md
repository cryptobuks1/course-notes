Structured Networking Notes

Domain Types

```
Workgroup

    CLIENT COMPUTERS ONLY; NO SERVER PRESENT        

Domain

    All computers joined to central DOMAIN CONTROLLER
    (DC).  IN WINDOWS ==> RUN ACTIVE DIRECTORY TO 
    CREATE A DOMAIN

Client/Server

    EG ONLINE BANKING : client logs in to server just
    for a short while

```

TOPOLOGIES

```
TOPOLOGY = LAYOUT, STRUCTURE EG OF MAP OR NETWORK 

BUS

    FIRST EVER NETWORK 

    SIMPLE WIRE WITH PCS CONNECTED TO WIRE!!!

    10 MBPS

    PROBLEM : SIGNAL BOUNCE !!  MUST 'TERMINATE' 
        BOTH ENDS WITH RESISTOR

    |-------------------------------------|
    terminate         pc      pc      terminate

    

RING

    TAKE BUS AND JOIN END-TO-END
    
    NETWORK HAS ONE 'TOKEN' AND ONLY WHEN YOU HAVE THE
    TOKEN CAN IT TRANSMIT ==> ONE AT A TIME ==> SO 
    NO 'NOISE' OR 'COLLISIONS'

    TOKEN RING (IBM) IS NO LONGER USED...

    RINGS ARE USED FOR WAN FAST FIBER NETWORKS TODAY

STAR

    ETHERNET

    SWITCH IN MIDDLE

    PCS JOIN

    ETHERNET 'FRAME' LOOKS LIKE

    | DESTINATION MAC | SOURCE MAC | DATA | CRC CHECK |

    MAC ADDRESS : UNIQUE ADDRESS GIVEN TO EVERY COMPUTER
        LOOKS LIKE : 30-85-A9-9A-6D-17

        = PHYSICAL ADDRESS
        = HARDWARE ADDRESS BECAUSE BURNED INTO
                YOUR PHYSICAL NETWORK CARD
    

MESH

    ACROSS A NATION, CRISS-CROSS OF NETWORKS.
    IDEA INITIALLY OF TCP/IP WAS INVENTED BY DEPT OF
    DEFENSE (US) TO SURVIVE NUCLEAR WAR (1959)

ALL PEOPLE SEEM TO NEED DATA PROCESSING
PLEASE DO NOT THROW SAUSAGE PIZZA AWAY

PHYSICAL

```
PHYSICALLY PULSE OUT ELECTRICITY FROM YOUR MACHINE TO
    NETWORK

COPPER : SEND OUT ELECTRICITY

    ETHERNET    8 WIRES IN CABLE, IN 4 PAIRS

        UTP    UNSHIELDED TWISTED PAIR (CHEAP)
        STP    SHIELDED TWISTED PAIR
        RJ45    NETWORK JACK : 8 WIRES
        RJ11    TELEPHONE JACK : 4 WIRES

    COAX
        RG58    THINNET, TV CABLE
        RG8    THICKNET, ORIGINAL 10MBPS
                THICK NETWORKING CABLE
            (STILL USED FOR TRUCKS TO RUN
                OVER A ROAD)

        CONNECTOR
            BNC CONNECTOR
            F CONNECTOR
    

FIBER  : SEND OUT LIGHT

    MONOMODE    EXPENSIVE PURE LASER LIGHT (50KM)

    MULTIMODE    CHEAP LED LIGHT (2KM) 

                USED IN MAN/CAN
                METROPOLITAN/CAMPUS NETWORK

    CONNECTORS : MT-RJ, ST, SC

WIFI   : SEND OUT E/M (ELECTROMAGNETIC) SIGNAL

ENCODING = PACKING UP YOUR DATA AND SENDING IT OUT

    EG MANCHESTER ENCODING

DEVICES AT LAYER 1

    CABLING

    NETWORK CARD

    HUB

        10MBPS
        SLOW
        PRIMITIVE
        NO FILTERING : DATA COMING IN JUST GETS
            SENT OUT AGAIN ON OTHER PORTS
            (BROADCAST ==> VERY BAD FOR TODAY'S
            NETWORKS)

    REPEATER    2-PORT HUB

        ETHERNET : MAX LENGTH OF 100M SO ADD
            REPEATER TO EXTEND

        5-4-3 RULE : 

```

DATA LINK : LAYER 2

```
USES MAC ADDRESS TO GET DATA ROUND OUR LAN

PC1 ---------- SWITCH ---------- PC2

ETHERNET 'FRAME' 

    | DATA |  SOURCE MAC  | DESTINATION MAC |

SWITCH CREATES A 'TABLE' OF CONNECTED COMPUTERS

    
    PORT        MAC
    1        AA-BB-CC-DD-EE-FF
    2        1A-2B-3C-4D-5E-6F

SWITCH CREATE A 'VIRTUAL CIRCUIT' TO CONNECT PC1 TO PC2
    GET FAST 1000MBPS ('GIGABIT') CONNECTION

DEVICE AT LAYER 2 : SWITCH

    (( BRIDGE : JOIN TWO DIFFERENT TYPES OF NETWORK
        EG TOKEN RING TO ETHERNET))

UPLINK PORT = TRUNK PORT ==> JOIN SWITCHES (10GBPS)

LAYER 2 SUMMARY

    ETHERNET
    MAC ADDRESS
    SWITCH

```

NETWORK (LAYER 3)

```
LAYER 1 : PHYSICAL
LAYER 2 : LAN LOCAL             MAC ADDRESS
LAYER 3 : WAN ACROSS INTERNET (GLOBAL)    IP ADDRESS

ROUTING

    ROUTERS TALK TO EACH OTHER TO SHARE INFORMATION

    EG 'RIP' = 'ROUTING INTERNET PROTOCOL'

        RIP : EVERY 30 SECONDS : BROADCAST ALL
            DATA ABOUT KNOWN ROUTES TO 
            NEIGHBOURS

    CREATE 'BEST ROUTES' ACROSS GLOBAL INTERNET

        QUICKEST ROUTES HAVE LOWEST 'METRIC' 
        WHICH IS A 'COST' (NUMBER OF HOP JUMPS
        ACROSS THE INTERNET)

        (( PATHPING
           TRACERT  ))

    OTHER PROTOCOLS 

        RIP        BROADCAST 30 SECS (BAD!)

        EIGRP        CISCO, FAST, MEASURES HOPS
                UNICAST TO SEND DATA,
                CHANGES ONLY

        OSPF        USES 'AREAS' SIMILAR TO 
                POSTING LETTER : CONTINENT=>
                COUNTRY=>REGION=>CITY=>
                SUBURB=>STREET=>NUMBER

        EGP / BGP    'BACKBONE' FAST PART
                OF INTERNET

IP PACKET

    |  DATA   | SOURCE IP |  DESTINATION IP |

```

TRANSPORT

```
LAYER 3 : IP : GETS DATA FROM A TO B

    PROBLEM !!!!  NO TRACKING FOR IP PACKETS !!!

LAYER 4 - SOLUTION !!! 

    TCP TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL

        SEQUENCE NUMBER = COUNT PACKETS OUT
                1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10

        ACK (ACKNOWLEDGEMENT) = COUNT PACKETS
                ARRIVED AND NOTIFY SENDER
                1,2,3,6,7,8,9,10

            !!! alert ==> 4,5 went missing!!!

            SENDER WILL KNOW AND RESEND 4,5
        
        
TCP    Checks and counts all packets in and out

    =     "CONNECTION-ORIENTED"  : EACH PACKET PART
                    OF A FLOW

    SLOW BUT GUARANTEED DATA!!!!

UDP    IF NO CHECKING IS REQUIRED, USE UDP INSTEAD

    FAST BUT NO CHECKING

        "CONNECTIONLESS"  : EACH PACKET INDEPENDENT

        EG YOUTUBE, INTERNET RADIO

```

SESSION

```
Manages streams of traffic into computer eg Video, Skype,
Email, etc

    ==> 5 tabs with 5 youtube videos : gets data to 
        right tab!!!

```

PRESENTATION

```
Encryption

    Secure HTTPS    

Compression

    eg WAV file (large audio file) ==> compress to MP3
       TIFF ==> JPG
       WMV  ==> MP4

```

APPLICATION

```
Talks to the program which makes request to use the network
    eg Browser, Outlook etc

```

VPN Virtual Private Network

```
LAN1----GATEWAY1================GATEWAY2----LAN2
           Encrypted
           VPN Tunnel
           Across Public
             Internet  ((TUNNEL MODE VPN))

PPP : Point-to-point protocol : CREATE A DIAL-UP CONNECTION

PPTP  :  Point-to-point TUNNELING PROTOCOL  (Microsoft, not
            used much - least secure)

        PORT 1723

L2TP / IPSEC  : Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol : Robust 
        security (USES CERTIFICATES)

        PORT 1701

            *** FIREWALL NEEDS TO BE OPENED ***

SSTP : Secure Sockets Tunneling Protocol

        PORT 443 (SSL, HTTPS)  

            (( GOOD AS DON'T HAVE TO ADJUST 
                FIREWALL ))

IKEV2  Internet Key Exchange
    VPN Auto-Reconnect : if disconnect, can reconnect
        again immediately for up to 30 minutes

EAP    : JUST A SHELL : PUT SECURITY INSIDE IT

    PEAP        Protected EAP : Password
    EAP-MSCHAP2    MS-Chap2      : Password
    EAP-TLS        TLS : HTTPS Certificates    

WRONG ANSWERS !!!

    PAP, CHAP       INSECURE.

```

VLAN Virtual LAN

```
REAL LAN : computers are separate from other LANs

VIRTUAL LAN (VLAN) : 

    Switch
    ========================================
     |    |                   |     |
    PC1  PC2        PC10   PC11

      VLAN10           VLAN20

    PC1 and PC2 ARE ADDED TO VLAN10

    PC10 and PC11 ARE ADDED TO VLAN20

    
    VLAN10  CAN'T TALK TO VLAN20  

    TECHNOLOGY : 802.1Q VLAN TAGGING : EACH PACKET
            GETS 'VLAN ID' (eg VLAN10)

VLAN SWITCH IS ALSO CALLED A 'MANAGED SWITCH' BECAUSE
    IT DEALS WITH 

            LAYER 2  (PORTS)
            LAYER 3  (VLAN) ==> EACH VLAN
                        GETS IP ADDRESS

```

NAP NETWORK ACCESS PROTECTION (NAC NETWORK ACCESS CONTROL)

```
CHECKS HEALTH OF ALL COMPUTERS ON NETWORK

1) VIRUS CHECK
2) WINDOWS UP TO DATE?
3) AV UP TO DATE?

If FAIL ==> Put computer on QUARANTINE NETWORK and 
    FORCE THE UPDATES etc until the machine
    receives a bill of good health.

    ==> Then JOIN NETWORK!!!

```

DMZ DE-MILITARIZED ZONE : NEUTRAL GROUND BETWEEN TWO ARMIES

```
DMZ = PERIMITER NETWORK

Extra network outside the edge of our LAN, to host eg
our public web server. If it gets hacked, it's not 
going to endanger our PRIVATE SECURE LAN!!!!

```

PROXY SERVER

```
Fake IP through which direct all of our internet traffic

    1) Monitor which users are online
    2) Virus/Download filter
    3) CACHE (STORE) web pages for future users
        looking at same page (faster)
    4) BILLING PURPOSES eg Internet Cafe

```

Binary

```
Bit    1 or 0
Byte    8 bits   10101010  min 0 max 255
Nibble  4 bits   1010 
KB    kilo    1024   aprox  1000        10 ^ 3
MB    Mega              1 million       10 ^ 6
GB      Giga              1 billion       10 ^ 9
TB    Tera              1 trillion      10 ^ 12
PB    Peta                  10 ^ 15

Kbps b = bits per second     USE FOR DATA TRANSFER
MB   B = BYTES STORAGE

```

Networking Protocols

FTP File Transfer Protocol

```
BASIC : SINCE FOUNDATION OF INTERNET

PORT 20/21

CARE ! PLAIN TEXT ! NOT SECURE !!!  EVEN PASSWORD SENT
        PLAIN TEXT !!!

SFTP encrypt over SSH  port 22

FTPS encrypt over SSL (HTTPS)  port 443

```

Bittorrent

```
Split large file into small pieces.  Each piece gets 
downloaded individually.  Clients can now also act
as sources for others to access these 'seeds' as well.

    = DISTRIBUTED (PEER-TO-PEER) FILE SHARING

```

Telnet 23 plain text commands

SSH Secure Shell Port 22 (Encrypted Telnet)

Email

```
SMTP    port 25        SEND

POP    port 110    RECEIVE

IMAP    port 143    RECEIVE

```

HTTP 80

HTTPS 443

DNS 53

DHCP 67

RDP 3389

NETBIOS 137

ICMP INTERNET CONTROL MESSAGE PROTOCOL : JOB IS TO SEND ERROR
MESSAGES BACK TO CLIENTS IF ERROR EG TIMEOUT, ACCESS
DENIED ETC

```
    << ping ==> part of ICMP family (echo request) >>

```

SNMP Simple Network Management Protocol

```
Used to manage devices

Central 'MIB' Management Info (data) Base

Client has 'agent' software 

    1) Heartbeat 30 seconds to say it is alive
    2) Throughput
    3) Data transferred

```

TFTP Trivial FTP : Non-secure but used on LAN eg CISCO to load
new operating system

```
PORT 69

```

ENCRYPTION (PAGE 28)

```
CRYPTOGRAPHY = SCIENCE OF ENCRYPTION

CIPHER = KEY

ALGORITHM = PROGRAM TO ENCRYPT DATA

    DATA ==> ALGORITHM + KEY ==> ENCYPTED TEXT
   (PLAIN                  (CIPHER TEXT)
    TEXT)

  Hello George =====================>  asd knmio Adc

TYPES OF ENCRYPTION
    
    1) SYMMETRIC
    2) ASYMMETRIC
    3) HASHING (ONE-WAY)

```

SYMMETRIC ENCRYPTION

```
FAST !

NOT VERY SECURE !

CONVENIENT SO IT'S USED A LOT!!!

    WIFI

    WINDOWS PASSWORDS ==> ENCRYPT 'EFS' DATA

WIFI

    ONE KEY IS USED BOTH TO ENCRYPT AND DECRYPT DATA

        "SYMMETRIC KEY"

EXAM : WIFI PROTOCOLS

    WEP    OLD, HACKED          ** WRONG ANSWER **

    WPA     (VISTA)            USED 'TKIP' TO ENCRYPT

    WPA2    CURRENT     USES 'AES' ENCRYPTION
                    (RIGHT ANSWER
                      IN EXAM)

    OLDER SYMMETRIC PROTOCOLS
        DES
        3DES
        BLOW/TWO FISH

WINDOWS

    YOUR PASSWORD IS USED TO ENCRYPT/DECRYPT DATA
    WHICH IS WHY IF YOU 'HACK' AND CHANGE YOUR
    PASSWORD YOU LOSE ALL ENCRYPTED DATA

BANKING / ONLINE 'SESSIONS'

    ALSO USE SYMMETRIC KEY BUT ONLY FOR EG 10 MINUTES
        SO STILL VERY SECURE

        " SESSION KEY "

```

HASHING (ONE-WAY ENCRYPTION)

```
CAN'T DECRYPT THIS : CAN ONLY GO ONE WAY !!!

EXAMPLES ONLINE

    sha1-online.com

    md5hashgenerator.com    

TWO PROTOCOLS USED

    MD5 (OLDER)
    SHA1 (GOVERNMENT APPROVED)

    also

    RIPEMD  (USED FOR HASHING TEXT FILES)

EXAMPLE

       PHILIP ==> 

    MD5 =>  3f2e2531201cfbf853f16f668132eaf2
    SHA1 => 3ba3974e96044dcde818e6310ed799abe10671d4

NOTE!  CHANGE SOURCE STRING EVEN BY A SPACE, THE HASH
    CHANGES COMPLETELY

   PHILIP + 'SPACE'

    MD5 => c187fab56db139f6a44c8da903745627

GOOD TO VERIFY FILE HAS NOT CHANGED!!!

    =  'DATA INTEGRITY'

RAINBOW TABLES

    ARE COLLECTIONS OF HASHES CRIMINALS USE TO TRY
    AND 'BACKTRACK' TO GET YOUR PASSWORD

PASSWORDS : YOUR PASSWORD IS NOT STORED - BUT THE HASH
        OF IT IS STORED!

```

ASYMMETRIC ENCRYPTION

```
ROCK SOLID ENCRYPTION!

VALID IN A COURT OF LAW!!!

    
TWO KEYS ARE USED - PRIVATE AND PUBLIC

    PUBLIC KEY : ANYONE CAN HAVE !!!

    PRIVATE KEY : ONLY YOU SHOULD HAVE EG ATM CARD
        IN YOUR WALLET OR YOUR PERSONAL CERTIFICATE
        STORE

    
ENCRYPT WITH ONE KEY : DECRYPT WITH OTHER

    DOES NOT MATTER WHICH WAY ROUND YOU USE THIS

    
PRACTICAL EXAMPLE

1) SEND FILE TO CHRISTIAN SO ONLY CHRISTIAN CAN READ FILE

    GET CHRISTIAN'S PUBLIC KEY (ANYONE CAN HAVE)

    ENCRYPT FILE USING THIS PUBLIC KEY

    SEND TO CHRISTIAN BY EMAIL

    ONLY CHRISTIAN CAN UNLOCK USING HIS PRIVATE KEY

2) VERIFY GROUP EMAIL CAME FROM VALID SOURCE (HQ)

    HQ WILL ENCRYPT EMAIL USING PRIVATE KEY OF HQ

    GROUP RECIPIENTS CAN DECRYPT USING PUBLIC KEY
        ==> SURE IT IS A VALID SOURCE

```

SIGNING A FILE

```
LAST TOPIC TO MENTION

1) GET YOUR FILE   EG  DATABASE TRANSACTION FOR $100000000

2) HASH YOUR FILE   ABCDEFASASJDSAKDFASJLDF

3) ENCRYPT THE HASH WITH YOUR 'PRIVATE KEY'

TO VALIDATE FILE IS GOOD  (IN COURT OF LAW)

1) DECRYPT THE HASH WITH YOUR 'PUBLIC KEY'

2) TAKE THE FILE AND GET THE HASH

3) CHECK THE HASH MATCHES

ANALOGUE 

	USING WAVE (NATURALLY OCCURRING) TO SEND DATA
	DOWN A WIRE

	MODEM : TAKE 1 0 1 0 0 STREAM AND PULSE IT DOWN
	A PHONE LINE  (OLD FAX 'SCREECH')

	USE TODAY EG CABLE TV

	ONE CABLE : HAVE MANY SIGNALS - SEPARATE WITH
		DIFFERENT WAVELENGTHS

		ONE THICK 'COAX' WIRE (COPPER)

		INSULATED ALSO

	TWO WAVES

			'MODULATES' THE CARRIER WAVE

	
DIGITAL

	SHARP, DISCRETE SIGNAL - SQUARE WAVEFORM

```

BROADCAST TYPES

```
BROADCAST

	SENDS ALL DATA TO ALL 'NODES'

HUB : OLD : TAKES DATA IN ON ONE PORT

		SENDS DATA OUT ON ALL OTHER PORTS

	** BAD FOR TODAY'S NETWORKS *** NOISE **

WHEN DO WE USE BROADCAST???

	EG DHCP : PC BOOTS, REQUESTS AN IP ADDRESS

UNICAST

	1-1 TRAFFIC BETWEEN 2 PCS

MULTICAST

	SENDING HUGE FILES TO A WHOLE NETWORK

	JUST ONE STREAM OF DATA : TAP INTO THAT ONE
		STREAM

		CREATE A MULTICAST 'GROUP' WITH 
		MEMBERS SO ONLY THOSE MEMBERS 
		ACCEPT DATA STREAM

		IGMP INTERNET GROUP MULTICAST PROTOCOL

ANYCAST

	IPV6 : EFFICIENT MECHANISM FOR SENDING DATA TO NEAREST
	DEVICE OR NODE OR NETWORK

	1) CREATE GROUP OF RELATED COMPUTERS

	2) SEND MESSAGE : AUTO-FIND NEAREST COMPUTER

	3) THAT COMPUTER WILL THEN AUTO-FIND NEXT NEAREST 
		COMPUTER ETC UNTIL GROUP REACHED

SERIAL : 1 WIRE : BITS SENT 1 BY 1

	SYNCHRONOUS : CLOCK TIMING USED ALSO

	ASYNCH : TWO SIDES NEGOTIATE BEST TRANSFER SPEED

PARALLEL

	NO LONGER USED NETWORKING...

	(( USEFUL EG 64 BITS AT A TIME INSIDE A PC ))

	PROBLEMS WITH SYNCHRONISATION THE FASTER WE GO

BASEBAND

	SINGLE CHANNEL : PRIMITIVE : NOT USED

BROADBAND

	SINGLE CHANNEL TO CARRY MULTIPLE STREAMS OF DATA

	OFTEN USING : THICK 'COAX' (CO-AXIAL CABLE)

	
	SENDING MULTIPLE CHANNELS AT SAME TIME

	MULTIPLEX : MULTIPLE CHANNELS

		TIME DIVISION

			EACH CHANNEL GETS BLOCK OF TIME	

		FREQUENCY DIVISION

			EACH CHANNEL GETS OWN FREQUENCY

BIT RATE      Mbps  b=bits   DATA TRANSFER

STORAGE DISK  MBps  MBytes 

BAUD RATE : ANOTHER NAME FOR UNITS OF DATA SENT PER SECOND

```

WAYS OF TRANSMITTING DATA

```
POLLING

	SERVER : CHECK AFTER TIME INTERVAL IF CLIENT HAS DATA TO SEND US

WIFI USES 'CSMA/CA'  COLLISION AVOIDANCE

	POLITE WAY TO DO NETWORKING

	NO-ONE TRANSMITS UNLESS ALL SILENT

	GET PERMISSION TO SEND : EVERYONE ELSE LET YOU TRANSMIT

	DONE : NEXT PERSON CAN BEGIN

ETHERNET USES CSMA/CD COLLISION DETECTION

	NOISY MAN'S VERSION 

	RANDOMLY TRANSMIT DATA....IF COLLISION...EVERYONE
		SHUTS DOWN...START RANDOM TIMER...BEGIN
		AGAIN WHEN TIMER GOES OFF..

```

ONE WIRE : MULTIPLE CHANNELS = MULTIPLEXING

		(LAYER 2  SERIAL CONNECTION)

	
ROUTER
	LOCAL LAN ROUTER (THAT YOU OWN)

	CORE ROUTER : PRIVATE OR PUBLIC : BACKBONE ROUTERS

SWITCHES (ADVANCED)

	NOTE : IGNORE TILL YOU'VE CLOCKED THE BASICS FIRST!

	CAM TABLE = MAC TABLE = SWITCH TABLE OF PORTS AND
		PCS CONNECTED TO SWITCH

	MANAGED SWITCH DOES VLANS (LAYERS 2&3)

		((MULTI-LAYER SWITCH))

		
	CONTENT SWITCH CAN ROUTE TRAFFIC DEPENDING ON THE
		APPLICATION BEHIND IT (LAYERS 4-7)
		

SWITCH MODES

	ALREADY DISCUSSED : SWITCHES FILTER TRAFFIC BASED
	ON MAC ADDRESS

	SLOW MODE : STORE-AND-FORWARD

			SWITCH : GET WHOLE ETHERNET FRAME
			         THEN INSPECT IT
				 ERROR CHECK
				 THEN SEND IT OUT

	FAST MODE : CUT-THROUGH

			SWITCH : INSPECT : ONLY DESTINATION 
				MAC AND JUST - SEND IT ON

	MIDDLE SPEED : FRAGMENT-FREE : CHECKING FIRST 64 BYTES

	

SWITCHING LOOP

	STP SPANNING TREE PROTOCOL

		AUTO-DETECT LOOPS IN OUR SWITCHES AND SHUT
		DOWN PORTS WHICH ARE 'REDUNDANT' IE DUPLICATE
		PATHS TO SAME POINT.

		ADVANTAGE : IN REALITY IF MAIN LINK FAILS, 
			STP DETECT ==> RE-OPEN SECOND LINK
		

		50 SECONDS TO CONFIGURE

		VERSION : RAPID STP : 20 SECONDS

```

VLANS

```
VLANS SPLIT A BIG LAN INTO SMALLER 'VIRTUAL' LANS

	EG CLASSROOMS : PCS CAN'T TALK BETWEEN ROOMS

VLANS ARE CREATED BY LABELING EACH PORT WITH A 'VLAN ID'

	PORT    VLAN

	1	VLAN1
	2	VLAN1
	3	VLAN1

	4	VLAN2
	5	VLAN2
	6	VLAN2

AFTER THIS, EVERY PACKET DESTINED FOR A PORT GETS EXTRA
	DATA 'TAGGED' IN THAT PACKET

	==> ADD VLAN ID NUMBER AS THE TAG

	SO PACKETS TO PORT 5 GET VLAN ID 2 TAG

	802.1Q = OFFICIAL VLAN TAGGING PROTOCOL NAME

PORT MIRRORING : DUPLICATE TRAFFIC EG FOR AUDITORS

TRUNKING : JOIN SWITCHES (FAST 10GBPS LINE)

	STACK SWITCHES : VLANS CAN SPAN MULTIPLE SWITCHES
	SO CRITICAL SWITCHES TALK TO EACH OTHER TO SHARE
	VLAN INFORMATION 

		VTP VLAN TRUNKING PROTOCOL DOES THIS

QOS : QUALITY OF SERVICE : PRIORITISE EG REAL-TIME VOICE

	WHAT DOES THIS MEAN???
	
		WE HAVE ONE NETWORK WHICH HAS ADDRESS
				192.168.1.0
		WE HAVE ONE PC WITH ADDRESS .74 ON 
				THAT NETWORK

	QUESTION : HOW MANY PCS ON CLASS C NETWORK???

		ANSWER : RANGE FROM 0 TO 255 MAX...

			ZERO ADDRESS : RESERVE FOR NETWORK
						ADDRESS

			LAST ADDRESS : 255 : RESERVE FOR
					BROADCAST ADDRESS

			SO SUBTRACT TWO ADDRESSES 

			IE 256 POSSIBLE - ZERO - BROADCAST

			   256 - 2 = 254 LEFT FOR PC USE

		GENERAL RULE

			NETWORK : PCS THAT YOU CAN HAVE 

				2^N - 2 ALWAYS

				N=NUMBER OF ZEROS IN MASK

BGP Border Gateway Protocol

Internet Backbone

Distance-vector routing = hops

Simple to set up

Problem : Infinite routing loop

Each router only gets partial vision of whole network : not complete

Link-state routing : Quality of route, Bandwidth of route, Availability Of Route

Use more bandwidth to transmit data but are more efficient in routing

OSPF

All routers have entire picture of full network

Needs structured network to work

Hybrid

EIGRP

Hops

Entire network in each routing table

Path-Vector Routing

Only target the border routers of other autonomous networks. Just record the vector path to each border router.

BGP Border Gateway Protocol works like this

Routing loops

Split Horizon

Don't send out routes to any router which already has you in its routing table

Poison Reverse

Give route back to original router as 16
