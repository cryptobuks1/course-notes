# Day 44 - GitHub Group Repo

# GitHub Clients

Please work on GitHub command line just on a daily basis, minimum

### Future Labs On Thursday ==> 3 or 4 group repos with a website, work together as a team

### Git clients

```
GitKraken
GitHub Desktop
VS Team Foundation

GitKraken and GitHub Desktop ==> please install both Git clients and connect 2 repos please and make some trivial changes to observe the process of making changes

Care!  With Visual Studio OPEN it can affect how the command line process works for pushing and pulling changes to GitHub

	If you are working with OTHERS then this can cause CONFUSION WITH FILES 

	So!  Either close Visual Studio 
	OR... Use Team Foundation

		We can push to 2 places
			1) GitHub
			2) Visual Studio create its own 'space' for your code
