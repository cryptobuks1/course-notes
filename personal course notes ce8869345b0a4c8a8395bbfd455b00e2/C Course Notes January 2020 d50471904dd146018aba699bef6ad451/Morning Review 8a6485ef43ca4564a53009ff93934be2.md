Review of topics learned Mon/Tues/Wed

Agile - Methodology of building software in ITERATIONS
Scrum
Sprints = Iterations
Sprint 0 : Initial 'MVP' Minimum Viable Product
Methodology - way of working
Lifecycle
Waterfall : linear process which starts at start and runs to end. Simple, fixed process.
Good for smaller, repeating, engineering (car software, bridge software),military...
Agile Principles value:
Face to face over other forms of communication
Collaboration over Negotiation
Working Software over good documentation
Embrace change over having fixed set of steps
SDLC Software Dev Lifecycle : 6 stages
Feasibility study : will it make sense?
Requirements Gathering
Talk to customer
List of requirements : Product 'Backlog' list
Architecture : High Level Overview Design/Plan
Tech
Legacy tie-in
Networking
Security
Constraints eg Legal etc
Design : Detail
Coding 'spec' (specification)
UI/UX
Database
Build
Test ((Care! Today TDD ie tests first, then code! ))
Release
Pipeline
Compile
Run Tests
Push to production
Maintenance
Helpdesk : a) Bug Fix b) New Feature Request
1/2/3 line
Documentation: Tech, User
Coder ==> README
Coder ==> Inline comments in code which can be extracted to provide semi-automatic technical programming documentation: ie reporting on CLASSES METHODS PROPERTIES FIELDS DATABASES
/// ==> AUTO-GENERATE A 'STUB'
V-model = Waterfall + extensive testing

```

Pareto 20 / 80 20% energy into 80% results
Eisenhower
1. NECESSITY ((URGENT AND IMPORTANT))
2. QUALITY (IMPORTANT WORK BUT NOT CRITICALLY URGENT)
3. DECEPTION (URGENT BUT NOT IMPORTANT)
4. WASTE (NEITHER IMPORTANT NOR URGENT)
Timebox : trigger action
POPIT IT at middle plus Organisation, People, Process
Triple Constraint : balance Quality vs Time vs Money
