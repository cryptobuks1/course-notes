# Communication

### Communication

As a Spartan, you are not working for yourself but for Sparta

```
You ==> Sparta ==> Client

Because we have 3 parties involved, it is paramount that good communication is a part of working life.

==> Sparta
==> Admin/HR of client
==> Manager
==> Team

Encourage you at Sparta in training to pretend as if you were already at work

	==> Trainer - timely, short, respectful

		TEAMS : INSTANT CHAT 
		EMAIL : FORMAL MESSAGES
```

Communication

```
VERBAL  content, actual words (what you say)
VOCAL   intonation            (how you say it)        
VISUAL  body language                                 most important!   55%
```

Listening

```
2 ears one mouth so LISTEN MORE THAN YOU SPEAK!

Exam ===> types of listening

		COSMETIC 				not really interested, casual 'oh', 'ok'..comments

		CONVERSATIONAL 		    passing interest, ask closed questions, keep conversation flowing

		ACTIVE                  probing with 'open' questions 'tell me more...' 'wow-sounds

Conflicts

Reasons for conflict

	COMMUNICATION : take great care with the written word as it can be misconstrued
	                money --> good to write things down
	VALUES
	WAY YOU WORK
