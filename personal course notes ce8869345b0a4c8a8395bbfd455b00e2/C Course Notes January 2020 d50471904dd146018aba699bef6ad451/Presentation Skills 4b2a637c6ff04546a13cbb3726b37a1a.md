# Presentation Skills

### Presentation Skills

As a coder we don't really have to worry about speaking too much - or do we?

Actually - with Agile --> it's all about a) Communication b) Applying that to intelligent technical work

Occasionally you might have to present your work

```
Why?

	Internal ==> Own team

	External ==> Other teams

			 ==> Client presentation of company's work

	Money!!!  Budget !!!

		You / your team might have a project PROPOSAL to make!!!  New idea, new feature,
		new way of working, new technology to try

			Have to CONVINCE others to 'buy in' to your idea

Sparta

	1. Intro

			Engage audience with small talk or questions ==> get some sort of engagement with the audience first, up front

	2. Outline / Contents

	3. Design

	4. Knowledge

	5. Conclusion

	Exam ==> Report 'rule of 5' : Intro, background to topic, transition into details,
										fine details, conclusion

			 Powerpoint 'rule of 3'     - 3 sections
			                            - 3 slides per topic

	Keep It Simple!
