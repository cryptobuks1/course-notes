```

Holiday Leave

Hi Rich

As discussed earlier this week would it be possible for me to take the week 24th Feb off on holiday?

Thank you

Phil
```

Tips

```
Letters have 'Dear Sir' and 'Yours Sincerely/Faithfully'

Emails

	Hi Tom ....

	Yours, Regards, Kind Regards, Thanks 

	Phil

If you are ASKING FOR SOMETHING then short and sweet often will get better response

	Managers : busy, short on time ==> LONG EMAILS WILL BE DELAYED
```

Send me 2 emails

1. Formal asking for time off
2. Friendly informal email

Chat communications

```
Whatsapp
Teams

	==> use as preferred method of communication 

		Check spelling at least!  Be aware it's a BUSINESS FORM OF COMMUNICATION

		Don't use TXTSPK if possible

			WUU2
			WBU
			BRB
```

Managing your life, files, inbox, emails etc !!!

Email management

	Inbox
		Topic1
		Topic2
		Topic3
	Archive
		==> in here, drag everything you don't want to delete but probably may never use
				again (but just keep just in case!)

	Aim for a ZERO INBOX POLICY ==> AND TRY DEALING WITH EMAILS FROM OLDEST FIRST NOT NEWEST!

Managing life and work and emails on a daily basis

	Recommend at some point every day, to go through all your emails

	But!!!  Good to 'batch' this so as not to be a 'slave' to your inbox

		Worst ==> reply quickly to meaningless messages or stuff which is not really important

		Tip ==> 'Go dark' every morning  and NOT ACTUALLY SEND ANY EMAILS AT ALL UNTIL YOUR WORK IS DONE OR FIXED TIME EG 3PM
