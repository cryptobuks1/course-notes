# Project Management

Project Management

```
BAU Business As Usual  (not running a project)

ROI Return On Investment (return for our effort eg invest in new project)

	£100 invested
	£110 final value
						ROI = 10%  (annual)

						ROI = ( final - initial ) / (initial)       * 100

Projects are ...

	Unique

	Clear goal

	Transient ie defined period of time

	Phases

	Involve skill of SPECIALISTS

	Involve COMPLEXITY

Triple Constraint : Time vs Money vs Quality

	work of HIGH QUALITY tends to cost MORE MONEY AND TIME in general

		((Personal Tip : don't skip on quality just to pressure for someone else's time agenda))

POPIT model

	Every company has a good mix of 

						       People

								IT 
						    (at middle)

		Processes                         Organisation
		(way you work)
```

Project Stages

Risks Associated With New Projects

```
Risk   % chance that something will go wrong

		Mathematically : Probability event X will cause loss Y

		Loss
			£££ financial
			or..
				key staff
				time
				reputation/credibility  ==> no hiding today!
