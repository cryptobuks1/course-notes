# Rest API

<pre>
	 
REST was invented in 2000 by Roy Fielding at University of California.  It has displaced SOAP and other XML-based methods of obtaining information because of its ease of use.
REST uses HTTP to transfer data.
REST is STATELESS (no knowledge of previous or future transactions ie each transaction is completely standalone)
REST exposes data using directory structure inside a URL www.mydomain.com/getdata/1  will get record 1
REST can transfer XML or JSON data.
Examples of certain public websites which off APIs for public use can be found here

REST API Video Tutorials

Here is an 8-minute overview video of what an API is and can do.  
It was released in 2014 so what worked then no longer works now, 
but it's useful anyway as a primer with some striking examples 
of what can be done with public APIs 
(note : the public APIs talked about have since added stricter authentication 
so you can't copy exactly some of the stuff talked about - you first have to 
now obtain an OAUTH TOKEN to use these websites)

CREATE AN APP FOR YOUR WEBSITE

    
NOW PASTE IN DETAILS INTO 

			https://graph.facebook.com/oauth/access_token?client_id=APP_ID&client_secret=APP_SECRET&grant_type=client_credentials

	
		
    
Facebook ID findmyfbid.com

    
Facebook Graph 
	Embed Facebook photos and posts
		
	http://graph.facebook.com/youtube      Error : OAuthException : Access token is required to access this resource
		
	http://graph.facebook.com/youtube?fields=id,name,likes

REST provides a 1-1 mapping with the basic CRUD operations Create, Read, Update, Delete with paths in a URL
	- GET reads data
	- POST adds data
	- PUT updates data
	- DELETE deletes data
