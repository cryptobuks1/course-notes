RAM (MODULE 2 UNIT 2)
	TWO TYPES OF RAM
		STATIC RAM
			EXPENSIVE (GOLD) AND USED INSIDE CPU
		DYNAMIC RAM
			CHEAP
			STORES CHARGE IN ‘CAPACITOR’ BUT THIS ‘LEAK’ SO HAVE TO ‘REFRESH’						CHARGE CONTINUALLY.
		
RAM TABLE							PINS
	SIMM		SINGLE SIDED 
	DIMM		DOUBLE SIDED (ALL TODAY)
	DRAM		DYNAMIC RAM (REFRESH)

DDR2	DDR TWICE IE X4 SPEED	240

LAPTOPS : SMALLER RAM : SODIMM

```
RAM SPEEDS
	RAM SPEED CAN BE QUOTED IN A COUPLE OF WAYS
		RAW SPEED EG 100MHZ  (RAW ‘BUS’ SPEED)
		DATA RATE SPEED EG DDR IS TWICE AS FAST : 200MHZ SPEED
		TRANSFER RATE (HOW MUCH DATA IS BEING SENT)
			EACH CLOCK PULSE WILL TRANSFER 1 BYTE 
			200MHZ  X 8 BYTES  1600 SO WE CAN CALL THIS
					PC-1600 RAM (DATA TRANSFER 1600MB MEGA BYTES / SECOND)
	EXAM 
		RAW BUS SPEED				X8 (BYTES TRANSFERRED)
	DDR		100		X2   200 (DDR-200) 	   PC-1600

	DDR3		100		X8 800 (DDR3-800)	   PC3-6400

```

RAM
SDRAM/DDR/DDR2/DDR3
TABLE OF SPEEDS
EG DDR2 RAM
RAW BUS SPEED = 133MHZ
DDR2 MEANS X 2 X 2 = X 4 133 X 4 = 533 MHZ
8 BITS FOR EACH CYCLE 533 X 8 => PC2-4200
REVERSE APPLIES : 4200/8 =~ 533/4 = ~133 RAW SPEED
BANK = MODULE ON RAM STICK
NORMALLY 8 BANKS PER RAM STICK

```
DUAL-CHANNEL RAM : INSTALL IN PAIRS

RAM AND ERROR CHECKING
REGULAR COMPUTERS DON’T NEED RAM ERROR CHECKING !!! SLOW WHOLE COMPUTER!!!
SERVER MISSION CRITICAL SO HAVING RAM CHECKING IS GOOD
TWO TYPES OF CHECKING
PARITY RAM : SIMPLE
8 BITS + 9TH ‘CHECKING’ BIT	10101010 IS EVEN (4 ONES) PARITY 0
111010101 ODD (5 ONES) PARITY 1
ECC RAM : ERROR CHECK & CORRECT (ECC = ERROR CORRECTING CODE)
TRYING TO DETECT AND FIX FAULTS!!!
ADVANCED
REGISTERED = BUFFERED MEMORY : ADVANCED ‘CUSHION’ FOR EXTRA STABILITY IN SYSTEMS
COMPATIBILITY
MODULES PHSICALLY DIFFERENT : CANNOT INSTALL SDRAM/DDR/DDR2 ETC TOGETHER
BUT!!!
DDR2 RAM	DIFFERENT SPEEDS PC2-4200 PC2-5400 WORKS AT SLOWEST SPEED

NETWORKING

OVERVIEW
Node	Any device, large or small, on network. Examples : Communications node, or could be a mobile phone.
Host	larger device eg PC or Server
Segment	Part of network
Backbone	Fastest part of network / internet
Router	Machine which talks to outer internet
Switch	Central ‘joining’ component of internal network : all computers linked to switch
Bandwidth	Speed
INTERNET	=	WAN	=	100Mbps
LOCAL	LAN	1000Mpbs or more eg 10Gbps

```
Sending Data
		Simplex			1 way only	eg RADIO
		Half Duplex		1 way at time	eg WALKIE TALKIE
		Full Duplex		2 ways at time  eg regular phone line

Interface	connection
	NIC = NETWORK INTERFACE CARD
TX	Transmit
RX 	Receive
		Transceiver : both send & receive

Protocol
	Agreed way for computers to communicate
		IP	Computer Address (location on internet)
		FTP	Sending files
		HTTP	Website data transfer
			HTTPS encrypted
		SMTP	Send email
	| -----------data = payload----------| header eg SOURCE IP AND DESTINATION IP |
Topology
	Layout of network
	Physical topology	WHAT YOU CAN SEE, TOUCH : REAL NETWORK
	Logical topology	SCHEMATIC 

	Point-to-point	:   Serial Line		(known as simple phone line)
	Bus Topology

	Ring Topology
		Take 2 ends of bus and join : get ring
		First networks => Token Ring (IBM)
			PC : have a ‘token’   it can now transmit
					CSMA/CA	CA = COLLISION AVOIDANCE (NO COLLISIONS)
						((Note : WIFI also uses same method ie super polite : get
						Permission for one node only to transmit at any one time))			IEEE 802.5

NAT – enables computers with PRIVATE IP ADDRESS (192.168.X.Y) to reach PUBLIC INTERNET
NAT – to provide a RETURN ADDRESS we add in an extra number called a PORT to provide UNIQUENESS
