## Introduction

Framework = set of policies put in place.

Compliance is testing if an organisation is putting the required policies into effect

## NIST National Institute Standards Technology

*NIST is used for guidance only*

*Exam question - most likely to use this one rather than ISO27001*

NIST 5 CORE FUNCTIONS / FRAMEWORK (guidance not best practice) 

       Identify (threats)

                     Manage Assets
                     Risk Assess
                     Govern
                     Business Environment
                     Risk Strategy
                     

       Protect (data and systems)
                     Information Processes
                     Access Control
                     User Training 
                     Data Security
                     Maintenance

       Detect
                     Events
                     Anomalies
                     Continuous Monitoring

       Respond
                     Response Plan
                     Comms
                     Analysis
                     Mitigate

       Recover
                            Recovery Plan
                            Improve
                            Comms

Implementation

       Partial, Risk Informed (Policies and procedures), Repeatable, Adaptive (continuous improvement)
       
Profiles

       Maximise productivity in expenditure by identifying 
       current and expected states, and investing to bring
       an organisation into an expected state

Secure By Default : out-of-the-box-security is turned on
                                          Design : programmers build with security in mind
                                          Deployment : info secure environment




## ISO 27001

Manages sensitive company information, keeping it secure.

Paid $$$ 

Applies Risk Management to help keep systems secure



## COBIT Control Objectives for IT

Business Framework for managing IT within a business framework.

Reflects role of IT in creating value for a company

Paid standard

CISA Certified Info Systems Auditor

CISM Certified Info Security Manager
       

## ITIL 

ITIL is a best practices framework

*Note : NIST is similar but guidance only*

Service Strategy

              Design
              Transition
              Operation

Continual Service Improvement



## TOGAF The Open Group Architecture Framework

Guidance on the architecture and design of an enterprise IT architecture

Modelling a business through IT


## SABSA Sherwood Applied Business Security Architecture

Deals with ENTERPRISE SECURITY AND SERVICE ARCHITECTURE

       What - ASSETS
       Why - MOTIVATION
       How - PROCESSES
       Who - PEOPLE
       Where - LOCATION
       When - TIME


## NIST 800-137 

Continuous Monitoring

## NIST 800-82

Protects SCADA

## NIST 800-88

Sanitizes devices

## NIST 800-53

Baseline security standards



## Policies

Password policies

Account management policies

AUP Acceptable Use = Fair Use

Privacy Policy

Surveillance

Security assurance = monitor data comms to ensure no data theft

Monitor data eg email, telephone

Physical monitoring : CCTV, alcohol/drugs test

Data classification

Data retention policy

Short term : version control

RPO in backups : last point at which a backup was taken

RTO : Recovery Time Objective : goal (in time) to get system up and running after a fault/attack - less than MTD Max Tolerable Downtime

Personnel Policy / Training

Separation of duties

Job Rotation

SOP Standard Operating Procedures

Dual control : shared ownership of critical areas

least privilege

auditing : decisions are recorded

mandatory vacation

rotation of duties / job rotation

succession planning

Mitigate personnel vulnerabilities with training and also with multi-factor authentication
