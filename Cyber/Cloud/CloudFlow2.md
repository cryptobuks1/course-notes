## Introduction and Random Thoughts From Class

#### Modern IT

Contrast with previous IT failures!

#### Software Development Life Cycle

Key words

Long Term Project

Scope

​	What we are / are not going to build!!!!

​	Scope drift ==> requirements can change over time!

​	Feature creep ==> lose clarity on management of what exactly we are building & features in it.

Requirements - Backlog - 

- Functional  -  what software DOES - does it FUNCTION?
- Non Functional 
  - Speed
  - Efficiency
  - Appearance
  - UI/UX User Interface / User Experience 

Sprint - short period of work with fixed focus and goal  

Agile  

​	Flexible

​	Ongoing change OK

​	Each step called an 'increment'  which is built in a 'sprint'

Waterfall

​	Fixed

​	Short Term Projects

Short Life Cycle

 'Retro' spective  =  review 





## Project Management



Project => specific body of work often with given start, middle, end and goal in mind

BAU Business As Usual => Day to day work!

Project ==> not business as usual.

Often require specialist help

​	Manage project

​	Consultant skills 



Manage 3 things

​	TIME

​	MONEY

​	RESOURCES

​		PEOPLE

​		ASSETS

​			FIXED - BUILDINGS

​			COMPUTER SYSTEMS



​	Use Gantt chart to help manage timescale aspect



#### Feasibility Study

Meet with client and discuss requirements

Initial analysis of project

Do we think it makes sense - 

	- technically
	- financially
 - risk analysis
   	- contingency

##### 

#### Methodology

Way of building software

​	Waterfall

​		V-Model

​	Agile

​		Scrum

​		Kanban



#### Waterfall and the 'Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC for short)'

First IT Projects

Initial analysis up front

built

release ==> too late!!!



Stages of SDLC 

##### Initial Analysis And Feasibility Study

- Can we predict success of project?  
- Any flags?
- Risks to consider?
- Financial basis?

##### Architecture = High Level Design

- Major thinking
- Big decisions
- Technical 'stack'
  - Linux
  - Windows
  - AWS Cloud
  - Databases?
  - Legacy technology to consider
    - Greenfield ==> no legacy
    - Brownfield ==> consider legacy 
- Output is
  - List of requirements = backlog
    - User Story => each item in backlog ==> write in form 'given..when...then..' ==> create these BDD tests



##### Low Level Design of 'Detail'

- Spec = specification
  - Document give to developer or graphic designers or ..
- Data / Database design 
  - Relationships between tables 
  - ID
- GUI design (UI/UX)



##### Build code



##### Test code



##### TDD => Test Driven Development

​	Tests written in code beforehand

​	Developers must write code so tests pass

​	 Red - Green - Refactor        

​			RED - WRITE TESTS AND THEY FAIL

​		 	GREEN - CODE PASSES TESTS

​			REFACTOR - EFFICIENT

##### BDD => Behaviour Driven Development 

​	Backlog list ==> User Stories =>  'Given..When..Then'  => Write tests in 'Cucumber / Gherkin' format ==> create tests for us in code

​	Epic ==== Project

​		Feature ===  Major Component Of Project

​			User Story === 'humanise' how feature will work and write in form of BDD ==> create test

​				

##### Release / Deploy code into production

3 environments

- Dev
  - Git branches
    - Master
      - Dev
        - Feature
- Staging ==> take 'Master' and put it ready to go live
- Live



##### Helpdesk Ongoing Support

- 1st line - easy fixes eg password reset
- 2nd line - tough fixes
- 3rd line  - deep code fix / specialist help



##### Documentation

- User
- Technical for support staff





##### Uses for waterfall today

- critical systems where either

  - life

  - large financial sums

    .. are at stake

  - Civil engineering - bridge, dam, power plant

  - Military



##### V-model

- use this where extra testing is needed at all stages of design



​         	Feasibility

​				Requirements Gathering                            UAT User Acceptance Testing    (user tests for us)

​					Analysis                                                 System Testing (as a whole)

​						Design                                     Integration  (modules together)

​							Build              

​								Test             =>          Unit Testing (one module)

## Agile

##### Problem with waterfall

- larger projects requirements can change during lifetime of development
- timescale between start and end 

##### Agile solutions

- Don't think long term but start simple and build out 
- Build in 'iterations' from simple to complex



![https://hangoutagile.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Scrum.jpg](https://hangoutagile.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Scrum.jpg)

##### Scrum Methodology (part of agile)

- Build in discrete stages 'sprints'
- Sprint 0 - planning
- Sprint 1 - first iteration - MVP Minimum Viable Product



##### Each 'sprint' is an agreed, discrete portion of work

- Sprint Planning Meeting  
  - Analyse existing **project** backlog of 'requirements'
  - Work with customer
  - Agree first increment 
  - Select for development items from backlog into development
    - Create '**sprint**' backlog of requirements for this sprint
      - Each item ==> ensure that 'definition of done' is clear
- Daily Standup
  - 3 questions
    - What you did yesterday
    - Plan for today
    - Blockers
- Sprint Review 
  - Check items are 'done'
  - Quality Assurance  (QA) 
    - Automated Tests
    - Static (manual) code tests / walkthrough 
      - Peer review when colleague examines your code
  - Invite customer to VIEW OUR WORK
  - Demonstrate code 
- Sprint Retrospective
  - Internal review
    - Internal practices - what can be improved!

### Scrum Team Members

- Customer  =  client   (not part of our team)
- Product Owner
  - Liaise with customer
  - Manage 'backlog'
- Dev team 3-9  ==> give timescale estimates
- Scrum Master (servant helper / coordinator)
  - Coordination meetings & timescales





### Other Agile Methodologies

Agile is any iterative process simple => complex

- Kanban  24/7 always 'on' model

### GitHub Pull Request



lab-submissions



​	master 

​		dev

​			presentation



Tonight when you send me your presentation (on Teams) also on GitHub you can create a README and let me know you have completed this work.

​	((Can attach presentation in GitHub))



```powershell
# show branches
git branch

# create dev and switch to it
git checkout -b dev

# push branch
git push -u origin dev

# push folder
git add .
git commit -m ..
git push



```







































# Random Terms

White box test - tester gets to see full code

Black box test - only get to see inputs and outputs
