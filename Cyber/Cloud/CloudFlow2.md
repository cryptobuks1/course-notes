## Introduction and Random Thoughts From Class

#### Modern IT

Contrast with previous IT failures!

#### Software Development Life Cycle

Key words

Long Term Project

Scope

​	What we are / are not going to build!!!!

​	Scope drift ==> requirements can change over time!

​	Feature creep ==> lose clarity on management of what exactly we are building & features in it.

Requirements - Backlog - 

- Functional  -  what software DOES - does it FUNCTION?
- Non Functional 
  - Speed
  - Efficiency
  - Appearance
  - UI/UX User Interface / User Experience 

Sprint - short period of work with fixed focus and goal  

Agile  

​	Flexible

​	Ongoing change OK

​	Each step called an 'increment'  which is built in a 'sprint'

Waterfall

​	Fixed

​	Short Term Projects

Short Life Cycle

 'Retro' spective  =  review 





## Project Management



Project => specific body of work often with given start, middle, end and goal in mind

BAU Business As Usual => Day to day work!

Project ==> not business as usual.

Often require specialist help

​	Manage project

​	Consultant skills 



Manage 3 things

​	TIME

​	MONEY

​	RESOURCES

​		PEOPLE

​		ASSETS

​			FIXED - BUILDINGS

​			COMPUTER SYSTEMS



​	Use Gantt chart to help manage timescale aspect



#### Feasibility Study

Meet with client and discuss requirements

Initial analysis of project

Do we think it makes sense - 

	- technically
	- financially
 - risk analysis
   	- contingency

##### 

#### Metholology

Way of building software

​	Waterfall

​		V-Model

​	Agile

​		Scrum

​		Kanban



#### Waterfall and the 'Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC for short)'

First IT Projects

Initial analysis up front

built

release ==> too late!!!



Stages of SDLC 

##### Initial Analysis And Feasibility Study

- Can we predict success of project?  
- Any flags?
- Risks to consider?
- Financial basis?

##### Architecture = High Level Design

- Major thinking
- Big decisions
- Technical 'stack'
  - Linux
  - Windows
  - AWS Cloud
  - Databases?
  - Legacy technology to consider
    - Greenfield ==> no legacy
    - Brownfield ==> consider legacy 



##### Low Level Design of 'Detail'

- Spec = specification
  - Document give to developer or graphic designers or ..
- Data / Database design 
  - Relationships between tables 
  - ID
- GUI design (UI/UX)



##### Build code



##### Test code



##### TDD => Test Driven Development

​	Tests written in code beforehand

​	Developers must write code so tests pass

​	 Red - Green - Refactor        

​			RED - WRITE TESTS AND THEY FAIL

​		 	GREEN - CODE PASSES TESTS

​			REFACTOR - EFFICIENT

##### BDD => Behaviour Driven Development 

​	























# Random Terms

White box test - tester gets to see full code

Black box test - only get to see inputs and outputs
