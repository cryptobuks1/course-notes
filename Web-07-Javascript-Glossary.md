This is when you should structure your comments to answer the question of WHY this code rather than the question of WHAT is this code doing.

Just using better names for functions and arguments simply makes most comments unnecessary. Keep that in mind before writing any comment.

webpack : bundler
babel : transpile 
chocolatey : software manage on Windows
WASM web assembly (webassembly.org) is like a mini-vm which runs on browsers, to enable C, C++ very fast apps to run in the browser
WASM demo https://webassembly.org/demo/
WASM on Windows is installed on top of Linux Subsystem plus Python plus Emscripten https://github.com/juj/emsdk
Blazor brings .NET via WASM web assembly
bower - ensures relative library versions are correct
yarn - manages packages via package.json package.json
yarn - install on Windows via MSI, chocolatey or Scoop, and via apt-get on Linux
webpack : packs your many javascript files into one single, or splits into modular load-on-demand, javascript files.  It can also do the same for CSS etc.
babel : transpiles modern javascript into older javascript
babel : can translate React JSX to older javascript
babel : needs `flow` or `typescript` to check types for it
grunt
gulp
chocolatey is a Windows software management solution via Powershell.
chocolatey creates nupkg files used to configure software
npm install gulp
npm install browser-sync
react 2.1 has typescript and tsconfig
react has typescript
mobx has state management for react
gatsby

kubernetes : deploy container apps in groups with unique IP DNS

docker was released in 2013
RUNC by docker : 2015 : Container Image Spec and Runtime Code : standardize containers
ContainerD project : donated by Docker to CNCF cloud native computing foundation in 2017
docker pull
docker run
docker ps -a
kubernetes : k8s : open-source : automate deployment, scaling and management of containerized applications
kubernetes : all containers which make up an application are grouped together
containers : google runs billions of containers a week
kubernetes : every container gets own IP and DNS and can do load balancing
kubernetes : mount storage of your choice
kubernetes : CNCF Cloud Native Computing Foundation
containers : OS virtualization : shared kernel but unique libraries and app
containers : isolated from each other
containers : have own file system
containers : portable
containers : one app goes in one container
containers : images produced at compile time

micro-services : applications can be deployed and managed dynamically

### Keeping Your Keys Safe

Exposure of your keys can lead to your account being compromised so it's important to keep the secure.

We can use environment variables to store our keys

List all environment variables (MAC)

```bash
printenv
```

Create `app-env` file

```bash
export API_KEY="ABDJFdfrpf956irjglkfmgi5kgf"
export TOKEN="213j29rhdfn94htrfuh94"
```

Add this file into the environment variables 

```bash
source app-env
```

Now using whatever code syntax is applicable for example in node

```javascript
var api-key = process.env.API_KEY
```

and also ignore the file in .gitignore

```bash
app-env
```

[React from Egghead](#react-from-egghead)

## Introduction

Statement by creators of React at Facebook

	*React is, in our opinion, the premier way to build big, fast Web apps with JavaScript. It has scaled very well for us at Facebook and Instagram.*

## Resources

[reactforbeginners.com](https://reactforbeginners.com)

## Comparison with other technologies



## React Clock

Here is a basic clock

```jsx
function tick() {
  const element = (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
      <h2>It is {new Date().toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
    </div>
  );
  ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('root'));
}

setInterval(tick, 1000);

```

The setInterval function calls function tick() every second.

This function tick() calls ReactDOM.render() so this gets called every second.

It renders the chosen element, in this case `hello world` plus a time string, to the screen at the position of the `div` element with id `root`.

React will compare the previous and current rendition of the screens in the virtual DOMs which it creates.  It will then only render the changes, making for a more efficient screen re-render.

We can see this visually by `inspecting` the clock with Chrome Dev Tools and expanding to see the relevant HTML element.  We can see the rest of the DOM is static but this little bit updates on every clock tick.

## Rendering An Element In Raw HTML

Before we talk about React let's talk about how raw HTML renders an element which goes something like this

```html
<div id="root"></div>
<script type="text/javascript">
const rootElement = document.getElementById('root')
const element = document.createElement('div')
element.textContent='Hello World'
element.className='container'
rootElement.appendChild(element)
</script>
```

[CSS Preprocessing](#css-preprocessing)

### CSS Preprocessing

Pre-processors extend CSS with

*	variables

*	operators

*	interpolations

*	functions

*	mixins

Pre-processing also helps with different CSS for different browsers

### SASS

```css
$font-size: 16px;
div {
    font-size: $font-size;
}
```

### LESS

```css
@font-size: 16px;

div {
    font-size: @font-size;
}
```

### Stylus

```css
font-size = 16px

div
    font-size font-size
```

### SASS Nesting

Preprocessors also help with nesting for better visual code

```css
$link-color: #999;
$link-hover: #229ed3;

ul {
    margin: 0;

    li {
        float: left;
    }

    a {
        color: $link-color;

        &:hover {
            color: $link-hover;
        }
    }
}
```

### SASS Mixins allow combining CSS properties

```css
@mixin bordered($width) {
    border: $width solid #ddd;

    &:hover {
        border-color: #999;
    }
}

h1 {
    @include bordered(5px);
}
```

### SASS Colour operations

```css
saturate($color, $amount)
desaturate($color, $amount)
lighten($color, $amount)
darken($color, $amount)
adjust-hue($color, $amount)
opacify($color, $amount)
transparentize($color, $amount)
mix($color1, $color2[, $amount])
grayscale($color)
complement($color)
```

### SASS If..Else

```css
@if lightness($color) > 30% {
    background-color: black;
}

@else {
    background-color: white;
}
```

### SASS Loops

```css
@for $i from 1px to 3px {
    .border-#{i} {
        border: $i solid blue;
    }
}
```

### SASS Maths Operations

```css
1cm * 1em => 1 cm * em
2in * 3in => 6 in * in
(1cm / 1em) * 4em => 4cm
2in + 3cm + 2pc => 3.514in
3in / 2in => 1.5
```

### SASS Importing Libraries

```css
@import "library";
@import "mixins/mixin.scss";
@import "reset.css";
```

### Typescript interfaces

We can use interfaces as a predicted class structure

```typescript
interface Person {
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
}
function greeter(person: Person) {
    return "Hello, " + person.firstName + " " + person.lastName;
}
let user = { firstName: "Jane", lastName: "User" };
document.body.innerHTML = greeter(user);
```

### Typescript Classes

Typescript has full support for ES6 classes

```typescript
class Student {
    fullName: string;
    constructor(public firstName: string, public middleInitial: string, public lastName: string) {
        this.fullName = firstName + " " + middleInitial + " " + lastName;
    }
}
interface Person {
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
}
function greeter(person : Person) {
    return "Hello, " + person.firstName + " " + person.lastName;
}
let user = new Student("Jane", "M.", "User");
document.body.innerHTML = greeter(user);
```

### Typescript tsconfig.json

The presence of tsconfig.json indicates this is the root of a project.

tsconfig specifies 
	root files
	compiler options

### Webpack

Webpack takes multiple files like `index.js` etc and bundles them into one `bundle.js` file

Code splitting then allows for different parts of the application to be loaded on demand

## BigInt

Can hold arbitrarily large integer numbers
[https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/05/bigint](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/05/bigint)

## Console Output

<pre>
  
javascript:console.log('hi');  // FROM THE BROWSER WINDOW!!! OR URL LINK!!!
console.log() produces black text
console.info() blue text with icon
console.debug() blu   
console.warn() yellow with icon

</pre>
  
## const

<pre>
  
const variables are 
UPPERCASE
block scope and even if global, not assigned to the Window object
const references to primitive values are always immutable 
const bindings are immutable but the contents of objects and arrays are not immutable so the contents can change - it is just the binding to the object or array object which does not change

</pre>
  
  
## Cordova - build multi-platform web apps

<pre>
  
npm install -g cordova
cordova create MyApp
cd MyApp
cordova platform add browser
cordova run browser

</pre>
  
## First Class Object

<pre>
  
First class object is an object that has methods and properties
Functions in Javascript can have properties and methods
So functions in Javascript are called First Class Objects or First Class Functions!
ie they are Function Objects
They can be passed as an argument to other objects as well, and can even be returned by a function. 
They can be assigned as a value to a variable.

</pre>
  
## Headers in HTML

<pre>
  
We can view the headers in an HTML page after loading by
going to Chrome Developer Tools, Network tab, clicking 
on the loaded file and then choosing 'Headers'

</pre>
  
## History.length/back/forward/go

<pre>
  
Accessing Browser History
History object is an ARRAY OF URLS LAST VISITED

history.length()  number of URLS

history.back()

history.forward()

history.go(URL) or go(-4)

For security reasons you can't access full list of URLs stored inside history object 

Most recent page document.referrer

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API

History  has length (back button), back(), forward(), go(x)

</pre>
  
## Immutable

<pre>
  
Immutable objects cannot change
const references to primitive objects are immutable
const x = 10; //this is immutable
const x = {} is not immutable so x.a=10 is fine to add afterwards.
Object.freeze(myObject) can be used to freeze myObject which is made up of key-value pairs, or an array.  

</pre>
  
## Lexical Scoping
  
Lexical scoping means private scope ie only valid within the block of code in which it is declared.
  
## Location

  
location = stats about current URL

location.href  is full current URL 

location.protocol  eg http

location.host/hostname = name of server

location.hash  ==> go to part of document where id="#"

protocol://hostname:port/pathname?search=#hash

Location = current URL : href protocol host hostname port pathway search hash

  
## OnResize Window Event

window.innerWidth/Height

jquery_30_resize_browser.htm

window.onresize()
  
## Primitive Types

<pre>
  
Primitive types in Javascript are
  number
  string
  boolean
  symbols
  null
  undefined

</pre>
  
## Progressive Javascript Framework

can be introduced gradually into your codebase

## Using Google - Is There A Demand For Your App?

Prove that DEMAND EXISTS FOR YOUR APP

Google Keyword Planner tool can look for the number of searches on this keyword

Build a landing page to garner interest and ask people to sign up for email notifications

## Mobile Apps

Lay out the flow and features. Validation of your app idea means that you’ve got something that people want to use. Now is the time to detail your product onto a document, or if you want to go the extra mile, use a wireframing tool.

When putting your idea down on paper, remember to be as detailed as possible. Include the flow of how the user will navigate the app as well as all the features envisioned. This will help your developer to clearly understand your expectations.

Remove non-core features. From the flow and features document you prepared, start looking closely at features that you can remove. Offer only the core value of your app idea. Do not build features in the first version that are "nice to have" and can always be added later as an update. This will help keep the initial costs of development down and also help you get to market quicker.

Put design first. 

Hire a designer/developer. Seek a development company that has great design talent and a solid development team. While hiring a developer, go online to check on their credibility and the apps that they have created. If you really liked an app they created from their portfolio, chances are, they could be the right one for your product.

Create developer accounts. You must register for a developer account with the respective app stores to be able to sell your app through their platform. Google’s Android charges $25 a year and Apple charges $99 annually. You have the option of registering as an individual or as a company, if you already have one formed.

Integrate analytics. Analytics help you track downloads, user engagement and retention for your mobile app. Make sure you use tools such as Flurry, which is available for free, and Localytics, that has a free and paid version.

Get feedback quickly and improvise. Once your app goes live on the app store, the first set of customers' usage and behavior will give you insight into how to improve and enhance your app. Enhancements and changes are constant, so keep an eye on user feedback and keep building.

Introduce features. You built version one with limited features and only the core offering. Now is the time to evaluate and introduce the remaining features that were left out in the initial version. You will know through analytics and feedback whether the features are relevant anymore.

Auth0 sponsors HapiJS 
Express : created 2010 - most popular Node http framework so far
Hapi : best for API
RESTful API uses HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
REST representational state transfer 
REST 1) decouple client/server 2) stateless 3) cache 4) layered 5) uniform interface
REST preferred over SOAP as SOAP larger XML requests

Glossary

    
	
Babel

Babel 
Just write Javascript 
	
Allows use of the latest standards without you worrying about compatibility
BACKBONEJS

	Model has Key-Value binding
	Collections of functions
	View has 'declarative' event handling (events declared in UI code)
	Connects over RESTful JSON interface
	Data represented as Model
		Create
		Validate
		Destroy
		Save to server
		Model changes ==> change 'trigger' event updates all views automatically
		
		Models sync with a 'persistence' layer usually REST API + DATABASE
	Collection is GROUP OF MODELS
		var myCollection =  Backbone.collection.extend({url: '/folder'});
		This allows use of the following 
			GET  /books/ .... collection.fetch();
			POST /books/ .... collection.create();
			GET  /books/1 ... model.fetch();
			PUT  /books/1 ... model.save();
			DEL  /books/1 ... model.destroy();
		COLLECTION DATA IS AS AN ARRAY [ {“item1”:”data1”}]
		MODEL DATA IS AS A JSON OBJECT {“FIELD”:”VALUE”}
	PARSING JSON RESPONSE FOR THE DATA THAT YOU ACTUALLY WANT
		IF COLLECTION COMES BACK WITH EXTRA DATA THEN YOU HAVE TO PARSE FOR THE
		NAMED DATA YOU ACTUALLY WANT 
		{
			“dontwant1”:”dontwantthis”,
			“books”:[
			{ “book1”:”data1” , “title”:”x”} ,
			{ “book2”:”data2” , “title”:”y”}
			]
		}
			SO TO EXTRACT THE DATA YOU WANT (BOOKS ARRAY) USE PARSE
			var Books = Backbone.Collection.extend({
			  url: '/books',
			 parse : function(data){
					return data.books;
				}
			});
Browserify

	
BUNDLES UP YOUR DEPENDENCIES FOR YOUR BROWSER 
		
http://browserify.org/
		
			Here is a tutorial on how to use Browserify on the command line to bundle up a simple file called main.js along with all of its dependencies:
			main.js
					var unique = require('uniq');
					var data = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6];
					console.log(unique(data));
							
			Install the uniq module with npm:
			
					npm install uniq
			
		Now recursively bundle up all the required modules starting at main.js into a single file called bundle.js with the browserify command:
		browserify main.js -o bundle.js
		Browserify parses the AST for require() calls to traverse the entire dependency graph of your project.
		Drop a single <script> tag into your html and you're done!
		<script src="bundle.js"></script>

Docker

Docker is the world's leading software container platform. 
	
Docker is a container technology in which containers are packed up with necessary libraries and 	dependencies in a standardized unit for software development

	Creating Node.js application
		First of all you have to create a new directory where you can dump all your files. The next thing is to create a package.json file in the directory create that describes your app and its libraries and dependencies.

			“version”: “1.0.0”,

				“start”: “node server.js”
			},
			“dependencies”: {
				“express”: “^4.13.3”
			}
		}
		
		
		Then, using the Express.js framework, create a server.js file defining a web app.
			
			'use strict';
			const express = require('express');
			// Constants
			const PORT = 8080;
			// App
			const app = express();
			app.get('/', function (req, res) {
			res.send('Hello world\n');
			});
			app.listen(PORT);
			console.log('Running on http://localhost:' + PORT);
	Create a Dockerfile
	
		The first thing you need to do is create an empty file called Dockerfile.
		touch Dockerfile
		
	Edit the Dockerfile 
	
		Then you have to specify from what image you want to build from. You can use the latest LTS (long term support) version argon of node which is available from the Docker Hub.
				FROM node:argon
	
		In order to keep the application code inside the image, you have to build a directory, which, of course, will be the working directory for your application.
				RUN mkdir -p /usr/src/app
				WORKDIR /usr/src/app
		The image comes with pre-installed NPM and Node.js. So installation of your app dependencies using the npm binary is the next thing to be done.
		
				COPY package.json /usr/src/app/
				RUN npm install
				
		Now you need to use the 'COPY' instruction in order to bundle your app's source code inside the Docker image.
			COPY . /usr/src/app
			
			
			
	
	
	
	
	
	
Docker Environment Variables

The standard for protecting sensitive credentials in production environments is to use Environment Variables 
Docker, via docker-compose and docker-compose.yml, easily allows developers to introduce environment variables and values, but you don't want to commit those to a repo, so the answer is creating a docker-compose.override.yml file on your local machine which contains the sensitive information:
The information in docker-compose.override.yml is added to (or overrides) the directives in docker-compose.yml.  
Since git and mercurial will allow you to commit docker-compose.override.yml files, the other important step is adding your docker-compose.override.yml file to your .gitignore or .hgignore file, preventing the file from being seen from the two version control tools.

const

const variables are 
UPPERCASE
block scope and even if global, not assigned to the Window object
const references to primitive values are always immutable 
const bindings are immutable but the contents of objects and arrays are not immutable so the contents can change - it is just the binding to the object or array object which does not change
Const Var Let

use const by default 
use let if rebinding is needed
don't use var at all!
Cordova - build multi-platform web apps

npm install -g cordova
cordova create MyApp
cd MyApp
cordova platform add browser
cordova run browser
First Class Object

First class object is an object that has methods and properties
Functions in Javascript can have properties and methods
So functions in Javascript are called First Class Objects or First Class Functions!
ie they are Function Objects
They can be passed as an argument to other objects as well, and can even be returned by a function. 
They can be assigned as a value to a variable.
Headers in HTML

We can view the headers in an HTML page after loading by
going to Chrome Developer Tools, Network tab, clicking 
on the loaded file and then choosing 'Headers'
History.length/back/forward/go
	
	Accessing Browser History
	History object is an ARRAY OF URLS LAST VISITED
	
	history.length()  number of URLS
	
	history.back()
	
	history.forward()
	
	history.go(URL) or go(-4)
	
	For security reasons you can't access full list of URLs stored inside history object 
	
	Most recent page document.referrer
	
	https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API
	
	
	History  has length (back button), back(), forward(), go(x)
	
	
Immutable

Immutable objects cannot change
const references to primitive objects are immutable
const x = 10; //this is immutable
const x = {} is not immutable so x.a=10 is fine to add afterwards.
Object.freeze(myObject) can be used to freeze myObject which is made up of key-value pairs, or an array.	
Lexical Scoping

Lexical scoping means private scope ie only valid within the block of code in which it is declared.
	
Location

	location = stats about current URL
	
	location.href  is full current URL 
	
	location.protocol  eg http
	
	location.host/hostname = name of server
	
	location.hash  ==> go to part of document where id="#"
	
	protocol://hostname:port/pathname?search=#hash
	
	
	
	Location = current URL : href protocol host hostname port pathway search hash
	
	
	
OnResize Window Event

	window.innerWidth/Height
	
	jquery_30_resize_browser.htm

Primitive Types

Primitive types in Javascript are
	number
	string
	boolean
	symbols
	null
	undefined

		alert("Come on now.  Don't you think you should read the EULA first?");
		document.getElementById("confirmEula").checked = false;
		openWin();
	} else if (document.getElementById("confirmEula").checked && !eula.closed) {
		eula.close();
	} else if (!document.getElementById("confirmEula").checked) {
		openWin();	
	}
}

Javascript Appendix

    
Javascript - The Good Parts - Douglas Crockford

    
Topic List

	Names
	Numbers
		64bit same as double
		no int type
	Strings
		char does not exist - just use one string with one character!
		"\u0041" allows ASCII / Unicode literal 
	Objects
		Literals
		Prototype
	Functions
		Objects
		Literals
			JSON
				x['y']
				x.y preferred as shorter
		Invocation
			Method / Function / Constructor
		Callback
	Inheritance
	Array
	Regex
	Functions
	Loose Typing
		Don't need complex class hierarchy
		Don't have to cast so much
	Dynamic Objects
	Expressive Object Literal Notation
	Prototypal Inheritance
		Objects directly inherit properties from other objects
	Augmenting Types
		Augment 'Function.prototype' with 'method'
		Augment Number to have 'integer' method which returns the integer of a number
		Augment String to have 'trim'
		Note : all values receive new methods even the ones which were created before
		Augment a method only if it is missing
    
New Object Creation : Object.create() method

	if ( typeof Object.create !== 'function' ){
		Object.create = function(o){
			var F = function(){};
			F.prototype = o;
			return new F();
  	};
	}
    
Replacing the Function.prototye with .method 

		Function.prototype.method = function(name,func){
			this.prototype[name] = func;
			return this;
		}
    
Creating a Number.integer method
</pre>

```javascript
Number.method('integer',function(){
	return this.Math[this<0?'ceil':'floor'](this);
});
```    

Creating a 'trim' method for Strings

```javascript
	String.method('trim',function(){
		return this.replace(/^\s+|\s+$/g,'');
	});
```    
Add a method conditionally

	Function.prototype.method = function(name, func){
		if(!this.prototype[name]){
			this.prototype[name] = func;
			return this;
		}
	};
    
Array

		Create is_array function 
			var is_array = function(value){
				return value && typeof value === 'object' && value.constructor === Array;
		};
    
Things To Change

    
For..in

	for (item in myObject){} will iterate of the object but also pull out all methods etc
		To only bring out the members, use
		for (itme in myObject){
		  if(object.hasOwnProperty(item)){  // code }
   	}
Not

 	! 
 		use (foo) instead of (foo != 0)
 		use (!foo) instead of (foo == 0)

    
Bad Parts

	Global Variables
		All top level variables are put together in the 'global object'

	Unavoidable Bad Parts (Appendix A)
		
		Function Scope : solved with 'let' keyword which gives Block Scope which is what we want
		
		Reserved words
			Many reserved words are not used!
			Can use reserved words but 'escape' with literals
		Unicode 
			http://unicode.org/charts/
			Javascript characters 16 bits
			Doesn't cover the 32 bit characters above this - treats as two separate 16 bit characters
		Typeof
			typeof(null) returns object so don't use!  Test instead for x === null
		Testing for type object
			typeof cannot tell between null and an object
			but can use the fact that if(null) returns false 
				if(null) console.log('hello');
					undefined
				if(!null) console.log('hello');
				  hello
		  therefore can use that to code this
		  	if(x && typeof(x)==='object') { //x is object or array }
		parseInt
			parseInt(08) converts from base 8 to base 10 so always use the following
			parseInt(myValue,10) which forces the result to return from base 10!
				(10 is called the 'radix' ie the number to which we count eg radix = 10 for base 10 counting)
		  tip : to convert to binary use x=parseInt(10101010,2) returns 170
		+
			if one string is null, returns the other string
			if both are numbers, adds them
			otherwise concatenate
				good practice : always ensure numbers are used before adding!
		Floating Point 
			0.1 + 0.2 = 0.30000000000000004
			Solution eg money is to multiply into integer whole numbers then convert back at the end
	  NaN
	  	typeof (NaN === 'number') is true so the type of NaN is a number type
	  NaN
	  	if NaN is the output then one of the inputs at some stage has been NaN
	  	suggested
	  	var isNumber = function isNumber(value){return ((typeof(value)==='number') && isFinite(value))};
	  	isNumber(2);
				true
			var isNumber = function isNumber(value){return ((typeof(value)==='number') && isFinite(value))};
			isNumber('hi');
			false
		Arrays
			Not like real arrays
			No bounds - can extend like queue/stack
			Typeof is object
			To detect if it is an array you must do
			if (Object.prototype.toString.apply(x)==='[object.Array]'){  // it's an array }
		hasOwnProperty
		objects
		null object
			test for if(typeof count[x] === 'number')
	
	Avoidable Bad Parts (Appendix B)
		==
			use === and !==
		with
			don't use
		eval
		continue
		switch fall through
		undefined is a global variable and you can change its value!
		NaN is a global variable and you can change its value!
		Single line expressions - don't use them !
			if (true)
				y=7;
				never do this but always use proper braces
			if (true) {
				y=7;
		  }
		}
		x++ and ++x - don't use them!  (JSLint bans them!)
		& 
			use &&
		| 
			use ||
		^ xor
		~ not
		>> >>> << bit shift - don't use as slow!
		Function declaration
			use var x = function(){}   NOT function x(){}
			use IIFE
				
				(function(){}()); to invoke an anonymous function
		new keyword
			don't use new Boolean/Number/String/Object/Array
				Object - just use {}
				Array  - just use []
			Better - don't use new at all!
		new with constructor
			new with function 
				if constructor is defined this is OK
				functions that take NEW (with constructor) should be PascalNamed
				functions that don't should be camelNamed
				or better still don't use new!?!?!?
		void
			don't use
		innerHTML
			never directly assign HTML received from a server to an innerHTML element because if it
			is corrupt it can contain a script block! validate it first!?!?!?
		/*  */  can conflict with regex so use // exclusively
		JSLint (Appendix C)
			JSLint is a quality checker for Javascript
			/*global               // lists all deliberate global variables here
			  global_var_01
			*/
			/*members       // lists all members so can check for mis-spellings
				var01,var02
			*/
			/*jslint   */      JSLint options
				eqeqeq forces === always
